It is\nfoundational to the FinOps framework, as you cannot control, optimize,\nor attribute business value to what you cannot see. To effectively\nmanage and optimize cloud costs in Snowflake, it's crucial to align\norganizationally to an accountability structure of spend, gain deep and\ngranular insight into all aspects of your cloud spending, and\ntransparently display it to the appropriate stakeholders to take action.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nThis\nsignificantly reduces the manual effort required for tagging and\nensures that new objects created within a tagged schema or propagated\nworkflow automatically inherit the correct cost attribution. Snowflake\nstrongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\nto enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\nWAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS to allocate usage\nto relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\nSnowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Tagging models**\nIn the initial setup of a business unit or use case, it is important to\nconsider the [model for tagging](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) costs within the platform via shared or dedicated resources. These fall\ninto three large buckets:\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate warehouses with a\ndepartment. You can use object tags to attribute the costs incurred by\nthose warehouses to that department entirely. **Resources shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of\nthis is a warehouse shared by users from different departments. In\nthis case, you use object tags to associate each user with a\ndepartment. The costs of queries are attributed to the users. Using\nthe object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by\ndepartment. **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\nqueries on behalf of its users.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits. Review each model before deploying resources. If an\norganization is caught between models, a common approach is to start in\na shared resource environment and graduate to dedicated resources as the\nworkload increases.\n**Tag enforcement**\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nClear and consistent naming conventions for accounts, warehouses,\ndatabases, schemas, and tables facilitate immediate cost understanding. Enforcing robust tagging policies (e.g., requiring specific tags for new\nresource creation and using automated scripts to identify untagged\nresources) is crucial for accurate data interpretation and effective\ncost management. Without tag enforcement, it is difficult to accurately\nallocate all costs and can require manual effort, like extensive\ntag-mapping tables. Tag values are enforced within an account, but if a\nmulti-account strategy is needed for your organization, a tag [database can be replicated](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) and leveraged across all accounts to ensure consistent values are used.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nFor best-in-class visibility, it is recommended to have a tagging\nstrategy and tag all resources in an organization to allocate costs to\nrelevant owners."]},{"url":"https://www.snowflake.com/en/pricing-options/cost-and-performance-optimization/","title":"FinOps on Snowflake: Built-In Cost and Performance Control","excerpts":["Section Title: FinOps on Snowflake > Go from painstaking configurations to a proven, fully-managed service\nContent:\nSince its founding in 2012, Snowflake has provided automated cluster management, maintenance and upgrades — all without downtime — so you can spend time on valuable data projects\nGet **[out-of-the-box governance and security through Snowflake Horizon Catalog](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/horizon/)** without extra configurations or protocols\nSection Title: FinOps on Snowflake > Go from piecemeal dashboards to built-in cost & performance management\nContent:\nGet granular visibility, control and optimization of Snowflake spend through a unified [Cost Management Interface](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-cost) .\nCheck query performance easily to proactively save on costs.\nAutomatically benefit from [regular rollouts of performance improvements](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/performance-improvements) across all workloads.\n ... \nSection Title: FinOps on Snowflake > Saving time on platform admin.
