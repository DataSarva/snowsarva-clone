This approach is important for enabling automation and\nscalability, allowing cost governance to be embedded directly into\noperational workflows, such as feeding anomaly data into third-party\nobservability tools or triggering automated incident response playbooks.\nA key best practice is to utilize this programmatic access to build\ncustom reports and dashboards that align with specific financial\nreporting needs and to create advanced, automated alerting mechanisms\nthat pipe anomaly data into established operational channels, such as\nSlack or PagerDuty.\n**Custom Anomaly Detection & Notification**\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Investigate anomalous consumption activity\nContent:\nAlthough anomalies are detected at the account and organization level,\nif you desire to detect anomalies at lower levels (e.g. warehouse or\ntable), it is recommended to leverage Snowflake’s [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) ML class and pair it with a Snowflake [alert](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) to notify owners of more granular anomalies that occur within the\necosystem. This ensures all levels of Snowflake cost can be monitored in\na proactive and effective way.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Forecast consumption based on business needs\nContent:\n**Historical trend analysis:** Analyze past usage for trends,\nseasonality, and outliers to inform future projections. Start with\nsimple trend-based forecasting and progressively move to more\nsophisticated models, leveraging Snowflake’s built-in [SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/forecasting) for time-series forecasting.\n**Driver-based forecasting:** Integrate planned business initiatives\nand new projects directly into the model. Collaborate with business\nleaders to gather strategic inputs such as projected customer growth,\nnew product launches, or increased data ingestion from marketing\ncampaigns.\n**Scenario modeling:** Develop multiple forecast scenarios (e.g.,\n\"conservative,\" \"base case,\" \"aggressive\") by applying varied growth\nfactors to key business drivers. This enables flexible planning and\nhelps mitigate financial risk."]},{"url":"https://medium.com/snowflake/machine-learning-based-alerts-for-snowflake-finops-8ec640fb1cee","title":"Machine Learning-Based Alerts for Snowflake FinOps | by Piotr Paczewski | Snowflake Builders Blog: Data Engineers, App Developers, AI, & Data Science | Medium","publish_date":"2023-12-04","excerpts":["Section Title: Machine Learning-Based Alerts for Snowflake FinOps > Overview\nContent:\nCost management is a key component of every successful cloud strategy.

While this article focuses on single-series data, it’s important to note that it’s also possible to use anomaly detection functions with multi-series data to build separate, independent ML models, for example, for each virtual warehouse object.\nThere are various approaches that can be taken to anomaly detection in Snowflake. The decision to implement ML-based anomaly detection should be assessed on case-by-case basis. In certain scenarios, simple approaches, such as threshold-based anomaly detection, might be more practical than implementing ML-based methods.\n*I am currently a Snowflake Solutions Consultant at Snowflake.

Perhaps an email when credit consumption on a virtual warehouse exceeds a specific threshold, or a notification if you haven’t received new data in a stage in more than 30 minutes. It’s important to know when a task may have failed to run in your task graph so you can investigate the reason and execute a solution. We all know how important it is to monitor your data and workloads, which is why we’re thrilled to announce two new features in private preview to help you observe both. The first is a new object called Snowflake Alerts. The second is no-code pipeline observability from within Snowsight, including task graph viewer and task history. Let’s explore both.\nSection Title: ... > Snowflake Alerts: Observability Into Your Data and Workloads\nContent:\nTo provide a repeatable and scalable way to proactively manage pipeline health, cost governance, and security risks, our native observability story continues to expand with the latest addition of Snowflake Alerts (currently in private preview). This has been a highly requested feature, and now our private preview customers can create alerts directly in Snowflake to gain observability into their data and workloads. When an alert is triggered, users can easily choose to take actions ranging from running SQL executables (e.g., to kick off downstream processing) to sending out a notification.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > A quick feature overview\nContent:\nInstead of manually querying the alert history table to see whether alerts are being triggered as expected, you can automate this progress by creating an alert to monitor the alert history table. This “alert on alerts” capability provides you with a self-service troubleshooting mechanism to quickly detect and respond when alert execution encounters an issue; for example, if the alert evaluation query continues to fail due to source data being unavailable.\n ... \nSection Title: Alerts and Observability for Pipeline Monitoring and Cost Management > ... > Task history\nContent:\nLooking for more data engineering insights to fuel your 2023?
