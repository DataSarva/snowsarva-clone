- Research (finops): documented foundational cost attribution primitives: ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY vs INFO_SCHEMA table function; METERING_HISTORY service-type breakdown; tagging joins via TAG_REFERENCES.
- Drafted SQL artifact for monthly compute credits by warehouse tag incl. idle credits + idle ratio.
- Research (finops): added note on ORG_USAGE vs ACCOUNT_USAGE cost attribution + used vs billed credits (WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY vs METERING_DAILY_HISTORY) and UTC reconciliation guidance; included org-wide SQL draft overlaying hourly warehouse used credits with daily billed credits.
- Research (finops): new note on Snowflake’s recommended cost attribution approach (object tags + query tags), resource monitor limitations (warehouses only), and tag-based budgets; includes SQL drafts for warehouse-tag showback + query-tag billed-proportional allocation.

- Infra: Brave web_search unavailable (missing BRAVE_API_KEY); relied on Parallel Search/Extract and direct Snowflake doc URLs for citations.
- Research (finops): wrote note on metering sources for FinOps + Native App monetization constraints: ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY (hourly) + METERING_DAILY_HISTORY (billed credits w/ cloud services adjustment) + Native App Custom Event Billing via SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENT; includes SQL draft view FACT_SERVICE_CREDITS_DAILY and monetization ADR. Note: research/finops/2026-03-01/2026-03-01_0216_snowflake-finops-native-app-metering-sources.md
- Research (finops): documented cost-intelligence primitives for the app: hourly warehouse metering vs daily billed credits; drafted daily idle-credits SQL + heuristic query-attribution pseudocode for spike triage. Note: research/finops/2026-03-01/2026-03-01_0422_cost-intelligence-metrics.md
- Research (finops): deep-read Snowflake Budgets custom actions + cycle-start actions (stored-proc requirements, retry/idempotency, task-based observability), Native App application configurations (sensitive values), and invoice access roles; drafted ADR + SQL artifacts for "Budget Action Pack" + action-run observability view. Note: research/finops/2026-03-01/2026-03-01_0423_budgets-actions-invoices-nativeapp-integration.md
- Updates watch: captured Snowflake release-notes deltas relevant to FinOps + Native Apps (budgets stored-proc actions, Snowsight invoices for On Demand, Native Apps config/IAC/shareback). Note: research/finops/2026-03-01/2026-03-01_0544_snowflake-release-notes-2026-02-24-nativeapps-budgets.md
- Research (finops): added a clean, app-ready summary of warehouse metering primitives + risks (consumed vs billed, latency, UTC reconciliation) with SQL artifacts for idle credits/ratio and consumed vs billed daily view. Note: research/finops/2026-03-01/2026-03-01_0630_warehouse-metering-attribution.md
- Research (finops): drafted ADR for cost-allocation tiering (ORG_USAGE tag-based org rollups vs per-account QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY for shared warehouses) + SQL drafts for org-wide COST_CENTER showback and billed cloud services reconciliation. Note: research/finops/2026-03-01/2026-03-01_0632_org-usage-cost-allocation.md
