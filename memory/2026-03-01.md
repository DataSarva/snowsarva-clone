- Research (finops): documented foundational cost attribution primitives: ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY vs INFO_SCHEMA table function; METERING_HISTORY service-type breakdown; tagging joins via TAG_REFERENCES.
- Drafted SQL artifact for monthly compute credits by warehouse tag incl. idle credits + idle ratio.
- Research (finops): added note on ORG_USAGE vs ACCOUNT_USAGE cost attribution + used vs billed credits (WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY vs METERING_DAILY_HISTORY) and UTC reconciliation guidance; included org-wide SQL draft overlaying hourly warehouse used credits with daily billed credits.
- Research (finops): new note on Snowflake’s recommended cost attribution approach (object tags + query tags), resource monitor limitations (warehouses only), and tag-based budgets; includes SQL drafts for warehouse-tag showback + query-tag billed-proportional allocation.

- Infra: Brave web_search unavailable (missing BRAVE_API_KEY); relied on Parallel Search/Extract and direct Snowflake doc URLs for citations.
- Research (finops): wrote note on metering sources for FinOps + Native App monetization constraints: ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY (hourly) + METERING_DAILY_HISTORY (billed credits w/ cloud services adjustment) + Native App Custom Event Billing via SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENT; includes SQL draft view FACT_SERVICE_CREDITS_DAILY and monetization ADR.
