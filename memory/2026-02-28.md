- Mission Control (finops): documented Snowflake credit-usage canonical model using ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY + ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY, with key caveats (latency, billed vs used credits, UTC reconciliation).
- Drafted SQL views for hourly warehouse credits incl. estimated idle compute and account-level service-type credits; captured citations to Snowflake docs.
- Added notes + SQL draft for canonical warehouse-hourly credits vs account-level daily **billed** credits model; included native-app-specific constraints (no temp tables/stages) + citations.
