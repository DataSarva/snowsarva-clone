- Research: mapped how to reconcile Snowflake "credits" views vs currency billing via `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY` and `METERING_DAILY_HISTORY`, including cloud services 10% adjustment semantics.
- Drafted SQL for a daily billing-vs-consumption reconciler (currency rollups by `SERVICE_TYPE` + billed credits after adjustments).
- Research: clarified primitives for showback/chargeback: `TAG_REFERENCES` joins with `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` and `QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` (noting idle time exclusion).
- Research: captured a canonical SQL draft to compute warehouse idle estimate as `SUM(credits_used_compute) - SUM(credits_attributed_compute_queries)`.
