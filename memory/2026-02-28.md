- FinOps research: identified core building blocks for chargeback/showback: ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY (hourly warehouse credits + idle credits), ACCOUNT_USAGE.TAG_REFERENCES (direct tag mappings), ORG_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY (daily $ overlay with ~72h latency).
- Drafted SQL for tag-based warehouse cost attribution and highlighted key caveats: timezone=UTC for reconciliation; WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY credits may not equal billed credits.
- Added per-query attribution lane: ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY for compute/QAS credits by query_tag/user; documented Snowflake pattern for proportional idle allocation using WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY.
- Controls note: Resource monitors apply to warehouses only (not serverless/AI); budgets needed for those categories.
