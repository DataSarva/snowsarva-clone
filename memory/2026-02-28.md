- Snowflake updates scan: Native Apps shareback GA (Feb 10), inter-app communication preview (Feb 13), app configuration preview (Feb 20). FinOps: budgets can call stored procedures on thresholds + cycle start (Feb 24). Wrote research note: research/native-apps/2026-02-28/2026-02-28_1139_snowflake-release-notes-feb-2026-finops-hooks.md
- FinOps research: Per-query compute attribution vs warehouse metering: QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY (365d; excludes idle + <=~100ms queries; ~8h latency) vs WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY; drafted SQL to allocate warehouse-hour idle deltas back to QUERY_TAG and documented policy risks. Note: research/finops/2026-02-28/2026-02-28_1318_query-attribution-vs-metering.md
- FinOps research: documented core ACCOUNT_USAGE cost attribution views (WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY, METERING_HISTORY, QUERY_HISTORY), their latencies, and drafted baseline SQL views for hourly idle credits + query_tag coverage. Note: research/finops/2026-02-28/2026-02-28_1531_cost-attribution-core-views.md
- FinOps research: clarified “truth sources” for (a) metered warehouse credits (WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY), (b) per-query attributed credits (QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY), and (c) org-level currency reconciliation (USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY); drafted daily SQL skeleton and ADR for labeling consumed vs billed credits + idle delta.
