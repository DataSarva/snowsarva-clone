## 04:56 UTC — Warehouse Sizing & Multi-Cluster Deep Research
- **Research Note:** `research/finops/2026-02-09/2026-02-09_0456_warehouse-sizing-mcc.md`
- **Sources:** 4 docs pages + consumption PDF
- **Key Findings:**
  - Gen2 standard warehouses now default in select regions (post June/July 2025 org creation)
  - MCW auto-suspend is warehouse-level (not cluster-level); SCALING_POLICY affects how clusters spin up/down
  - Gen1→Gen2 conversion without suspend = double billing during transition
  - Data loading performance: file count/size matters more than warehouse size
- **Artifacts Created:**
  - SQL: WAREHOUSE_COST_BREAKDOWN view (credit consumption + utilization flag)
  - ADR-style checklist for MCW pre-deployment configuration
- **Next Topics for Rotation:** auto-suspend/resume deep dive, query acceleration, guardrails/resource monitors

## 10:30 UTC — Release notes scan (Native Apps + observability + org-wide FinOps views)
- **Research Note:** `research/native-apps/2026-02-09/2026-02-09_1030_release-notes-10-3-org-usage-listing-observability.md`
- **Notable items:**
  - Owner’s-rights contexts (incl. Native Apps) now allow most SHOW/DESCRIBE + INFORMATION_SCHEMA access (with history exceptions)
  - Listing/share observability GA (INFO_SCHEMA + ACCOUNT_USAGE + ACCESS_HISTORY coverage)
  - New ORG_USAGE premium views rolling out (hourly metering + query attribution)
