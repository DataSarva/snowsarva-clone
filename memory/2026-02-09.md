## 04:56 UTC — Warehouse Sizing & Multi-Cluster Deep Research
- **Research Note:** `research/finops/2026-02-09/2026-02-09_0456_warehouse-sizing-mcc.md`
- **Sources:** 4 docs pages + consumption PDF
- **Key Findings:**
  - Gen2 standard warehouses now default in select regions (post June/July 2025 org creation)
  - MCW auto-suspend is warehouse-level (not cluster-level); SCALING_POLICY affects how clusters spin up/down
  - Gen1→Gen2 conversion without suspend = double billing during transition
  - Data loading performance: file count/size matters more than warehouse size
- **Artifacts Created:**
  - SQL: WAREHOUSE_COST_BREAKDOWN view (credit consumption + utilization flag)
  - ADR-style checklist for MCW pre-deployment configuration
- **Next Topics for Rotation:** auto-suspend/resume deep dive, query acceleration, guardrails/resource monitors
