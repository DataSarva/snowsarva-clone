# Memory Log - 2026-02-18

## Research Completed
- Created warehouse cost intelligence research note (4 cited sources)
- Key finding: Idle time can be isolated via `CREDITS_ATTRIBUTED_COMPUTE_QUERIES` vs `CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE` delta in WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
- New SQL patterns: Query-level cost attribution via time-weighted allocation
- Checked Snowflake release notes (Feb 2026): Native Apps **Inter-App Communication (Preview)** + **Shareback (GA)**; also Performance Explorer enhancements (Preview) and `ACCESS_HISTORY` truncation behavior change.

## Feature Ideas Generated
1. Idle Warehouse Detection Dashboard (PR-sized)
2. Query-Level Cost Attribution (PR-sized)
3. Warehouse Right-Size Recommendation Engine (PR-sized)
4. Auto-Suspend Optimizer using ML (larger effort)
5. Multi-cluster Efficiency Report (PR-sized)

## Recommendation
**Ship first:** Idle Warehouse Detection Dashboard - provides immediate value, clear ROI signal, and sets foundation for more advanced features.
