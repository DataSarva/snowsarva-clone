- Snowflake release notes: Native Apps Shareback is GA (opt-in consumer permission to share data back to provider/3rd parties). New listing/share observability views in INFO_SCHEMA + ACCOUNT_USAGE (incl. ACCESS_HISTORY DDL capture). Strong Authentication Hub preview.
- 10.3 release: owner’s-rights contexts (incl. Native Apps) now allow most SHOW/DESCRIBE and allow INFORMATION_SCHEMA access; some history functions still restricted.
- FinOps: new ORGANIZATION_USAGE premium views incl. QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY (query-level cost attribution across org accounts) + METERING_HISTORY (hourly credits per account).
- Ops: Snowflake Updates Watch cron is currently unable to run web_search (missing BRAVE_API_KEY) and Parallel Search isn’t available as a tool → risk of missing updates.
