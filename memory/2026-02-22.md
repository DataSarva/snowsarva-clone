## Deep Research Session - FinOps Cost Optimization

**Time:** 09:45 UTC
**Topic:** ACCOUNT_USAGE views for FinOps Native App

### Key Discoveries

- **Warehouse idle time is NOT directly exposed** - must calculate from `CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE - CREDITS_ATTRIBUTED_COMPUTE_QUERIES` in `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY`
- **METERING_HISTORY contains 30+ service types** including Snowpark Container Services, serverless tasks, and various cost buckets
- **Cloud services have 6-hour latency** vs 3 hours for compute, complicating real-time dashboards
- **QUERY_HISTORY now has `query_load_percent`** - shows % of warehouse resources used per query (great for resizing decisions)
- **Query hash fields (`query_hash`, `query_parameterized_hash`)** enable pattern analysis across time periods

### Artifacts Created

- Research note: `research/finops/2026-02-22/2026-02-22_0945_account-usage-cost-optimization-deep-dive.md`
- 3 SQL query templates for:
  1. Warehouse idle cost calculator
  2. Daily service consumption breakdown
  3. Top expensive query patterns by hash

### Blockers

- Parallel API key was invalid - had to use web_fetch instead (slower, less depth)
- Native App pricing docs were 404 for many URLs attempted

### Next Research Topics

- ORG_USAGE views for multi-account FinOps
- Native App monetization/model

## Snowflake Updates Watch - Native Apps
