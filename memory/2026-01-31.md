- Daily FinOps/Native App digest: unable to pull fresh Snowflake release notes/blogs today due to missing web_search API key + browser service; focused on concrete Native App feature ideas + a small shippable cost-attribution mart PR.
- Proposed PR: implement tag/query/warehouse cost attribution views + daily refresh task using ACCOUNT_USAGE/ORGANIZATION_USAGE, forming foundation for anomaly detection + tuning recommendations.
