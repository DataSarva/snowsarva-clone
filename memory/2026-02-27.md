- Research (FinOps): drafted cost data model v1 using ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY + WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY; added doc-backed idle cost KPI + noted resource monitors are warehouses-only (budgets needed for serverless/AI). Links captured in research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1145_cost-data-model-v1.md
- Research (FinOps): added "all-in" cost-by-query_tag SQL that allocates warehouse idle credits using WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY residual vs QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY execution credits. Note: QAH excludes idle time + very short queries; latency up to ~8h. Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1351_cost-attribution-idle-time.md
- Research (FinOps): clarified org-wide attribution architecture: ORG_USAGE supports warehouse metering + tag joins for dedicated resources, but there is no ORG_USAGE equivalent of QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY (shared resources require per-account collection).
