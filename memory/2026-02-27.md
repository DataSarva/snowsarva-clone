- Researched Snowflake FinOps metering primitives; drafted daily warehouse credits + idle-cost fact model using ACCOUNT_USAGE metering views.
- Researched ORG-level cost primitives: ORG_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY (daily credits, ~2h latency, 365d) + ORG_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY (daily currency, up to 72h latency, mutable until month close).
- Key doc takeaways: WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY + METERING_HISTORY are hourly (365d); resource monitors apply only to warehouses (budgets for serverless/AI).
- Snowflake release notes (Feb 2026): Native Apps Shareback GA; Inter-App Communication (Preview); Application Configuration (Preview).
- FinOps: Budgets can trigger stored procedures on spend thresholds + at cycle start; invoices view/download in Snowsight.
- Created FinOps research note on Snowflake cost attribution + ACCOUNT_USAGE/INFO_SCHEMA metering sources and a draft SQL pattern for warehouse + per-query credit attribution.

- Added docs-backed notes: cloud services billed only when >10% of daily warehouse usage; use ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY for billed cloud services; WAREHOUSE_EVENTS_HISTORY exposes autosuspend/autoresume/resizes with cost-impact notes (latency up to ~3h).
- Drafted an ORG_USAGE-first daily credits normalization pattern + explicit reconciliation guardrail (`ALTER SESSION SET TIMEZONE = UTC;`) and captured org access requirements (GLOBALORGADMIN / SNOWFLAKE application roles vs SNOWFLAKE database roles in ORGADMIN-enabled accounts).
