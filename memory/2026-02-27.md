- FinOps research: drafted a warehouse-hour cost attribution model that allocates `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY.CREDITS_ATTRIBUTED_COMPUTE_QUERIES` to `QUERY_HISTORY.QUERY_TAG` using execution-time weighting.
- Noted control-plane gap: resource monitors apply to user-managed warehouses only; serverless/AI spend must be tracked via budgets + `METERING_HISTORY` service types.
