- Research (FinOps): drafted cost data model v1 using ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY + WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY; added doc-backed idle cost KPI + noted resource monitors are warehouses-only (budgets needed for serverless/AI). Links captured in research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1145_cost-data-model-v1.md
- Research (FinOps): added "all-in" cost-by-query_tag SQL that allocates warehouse idle credits using WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY residual vs QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY execution credits. Note: QAH excludes idle time + very short queries; latency up to ~8h. Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1351_cost-attribution-idle-time.md
- Research (FinOps): clarified org-wide attribution architecture: ORG_USAGE supports warehouse metering + tag joins for dedicated resources, but there is no ORG_USAGE equivalent of QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY (shared resources require per-account collection). Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1352_org-usage-cost-attribution.md
- Research (FinOps): documented Snowflake Budgets as monthly credit guardrails with notifications (email/queue/webhook), refresh latency (~6.5h default, 1h low-latency at higher cost), and stored-procedure action hooks; drafted unified showback SQL combining object tags + query tags. Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1554_cost-attribution-budgets-native-app.md
- Research (FinOps): compiled doc-validated building blocks for warehouse showback + alerting: ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY (hourly credits + idle estimate), ACCOUNT_USAGE.TAG_REFERENCES (direct tag associations), and resource monitor constraints (warehouses-only). Drafted daily cost_center allocation SQL. Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1556_cost-attribution-alerting.md
- Snowflake updates (2026-02-27): Budgets now support stored-procedure hooks for threshold events + cycle-start actions (release note Feb 24, 2026). Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1735_budgets-user-defined-actions.md
- Snowflake updates (2026-02-27): Native Apps gained Application Configuration (Preview) incl. sensitive config values + Inter-App Communication (Preview). Research note: research/native-apps/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1735_app-configuration-and-inter-app-communication.md
- Research (FinOps): doc-backed cost-intelligence “source-of-truth” notes for APP: metering vs attribution vs org billing views + their latencies/limitations; drafted FINOPS_DAILY_COST_V1 SQL incl. idle residual allocation + timezone reconciliation guidance. Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1803_cost-intelligence-views-metrics.md
- Research (FinOps): drafted "two-tier truth" ADR + minimal daily fact tables (warehouse credits + service-type credits + optional org currency) anchored to METERING_HISTORY / WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY / ORG_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY. Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_1806_usage-cost-data-model.md
- Research (FinOps): captured doc-backed “cost drivers” primitives for MVP dashboards: ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY (service-type ledger), ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY (idle residual via attributed query credits), plus quickstart SQL for approximate user/app allocation. Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_2015_cost-drivers-usage-views.md
- Research (FinOps): drafted a concrete, doc-aligned warehouse compute **cost-by-QUERY_TAG** model using ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY + hourly idle residual allocation via WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY; noted exclusions (idle + non-warehouse costs) and latency (~8h). Research note: research/finops/2026-02-27/2026-02-27_2017_query-attribution-cost-model.md
