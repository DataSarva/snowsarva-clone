- Created FinOps research note (2026-02-27_0310_cost-intelligence-mvp) on Snowflake cost/usage “source of truth” views (ACCOUNT_USAGE metering + warehouse metering + query history) with SQL drafts for billed credits ledger + idle cost, plus a reconciliable cost allocation model.
- Notable nuance: WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and QUERY_HISTORY credit fields are not billed-adjusted for cloud services; METERING_DAILY_HISTORY contains CREDITS_ADJUSTMENT_CLOUD_SERVICES and CREDITS_BILLED (use for totals).
- Researched Snowflake cost attribution primitives for a FinOps Native App: object tags + query tags joined with ACCOUNT_USAGE views (WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY, QUERY_HISTORY) and cost-attribution guidance.
- Captured budget vs resource monitor split: resource monitors cover warehouses only; budgets cover serverless/AI services too and can emit notifications + trigger stored-proc actions (trade-off: low-latency budgets cost more).
