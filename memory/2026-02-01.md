- Researched Snowflake Event Tables + Native Apps provider event sharing model; created observability research note with concrete SQL starter queries and provider/consumer constraints.
- Drafted initial internal schema DDL for FinOps Native App (attribution config + telemetry facts + recommendation tracking).
- Implemented a concrete telemetry v0 pipeline draft: 15-minute window facts from EVENTS_VIEW via SQL stored procedure + task (see sql/telemetry_v0_pipeline.sql) and ADR_0001_telemetry_scope.md.
