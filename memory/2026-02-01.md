- Research: mapped Snowflake primitives for Native App cost/metering (ACCOUNT_USAGE WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY) vs marketplace monetization (Custom Event Billing), plus provider monitoring via SYSTEM$REPORT_HEALTH_STATUS + APPLICATION_STATE.

- Researched Snowflake Event Tables + Native Apps provider event sharing model; created observability research note with concrete SQL starter queries and provider/consumer constraints.
- Drafted initial internal schema DDL for FinOps Native App (attribution config + telemetry facts + recommendation tracking).
- Implemented a concrete telemetry v0 pipeline draft: 15-minute window facts from EVENTS_VIEW via SQL stored procedure + task (see sql/telemetry_v0_pipeline.sql) and ADR_0001_telemetry_scope.md.
- Decision: bind values (`QUERY_HISTORY.bind_values` / `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BIND_VALUES`) are **OFF by default** in MVP; only opt-in later with redaction/hashing-first handling (ADR_0002_bind_values_policy.md).
- Created finops research note on Snowflake cost attribution primitives (object tags + query tags), key ACCOUNT_USAGE views (TAG_REFERENCES, WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY, QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY), and tag-based budgets; included draft SQL view for daily credits by COST_CENTER.
- Daily digest: highlighted `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` idle-cost calc + `QUERY_HISTORY.query_tag` coverage as immediate Native App FinOps levers; proposed an MVP “warehouse idle credits” card.
- Updates watch: Snowflake 10.1 (Jan 19–23 2026) GA’d retrieving bind variable values via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BIND_VALUES` + new `QUERY_HISTORY.bind_values` field (guarded by `ALLOW_BIND_VALUES_ACCESS`). Potentially high value for cost attribution on parameterized queries but privacy-sensitive.
- Research: warehouse cost-optimization levers (auto-suspend, multi-cluster max/min) and a concrete SQL draft for (a) config drift detection and (b) estimating idle credits as `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` minus `QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY`.
