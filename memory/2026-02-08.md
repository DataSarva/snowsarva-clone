## Research: FinOps + Native Apps Digest
- **Trust Center Overview** released (Preview) - new governance visibility feature for FinOps apps
- **Listing & Share Observability** went GA Feb 2 - new `ACCOUNT_USAGE.LISTINGS`, `SHARES`, `GRANTS_TO_SHARES` views
- New `ORGANIZATION_USAGE` premium views for multi-account cost visibility (Feb 1)
- Research note created: `research/finops/2026-02-08/2026-02-08_1400_daily_finops_nativeapp_digest.md`

## Feature Opportunity
- **Share Cost Attribution** using new GA views - recommended PR for this week (3-4 days, low blocker risk)
- **Org-wide query-level chargeback** unlocked by new `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` premium view (rollout by Feb 9, 2026).
- **Native App self-diagnostics** improved: release 10.3 expands owner’s-rights contexts to allow most `SHOW`/`DESCRIBE` + `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
