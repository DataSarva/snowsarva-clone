## Research Session: FinOps Cost Optimization Framework

**Time:** 18:53 UTC
**Trigger:** Continuous Deep Research cron (every 2h)

### What was done
- Executed Parallel Search for "Snowflake FinOps cost optimization" and "Snowflake Native App Framework
- Extracted deep content from 2 authoritative sources (Snowflake docs + Revefi)
- Created research note: `research/finops/2026-02-20/2026-02-20_1853_finops-cost-optimization-framework.md`

### Key findings
- Snowflake's cost management framework = visibility + control + optimization
- FinOps adoption can reduce costs 20-30% (McKinsey data)
- Primary cost drivers: Compute (warehouses), Storage, Data Transfer
- Idle warehouses with < 1% utilization should be downsized
- ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY + WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY are primary data sources

### Artifacts produced
- SQL: Idle warehouse detection query
- SQL: Cost attribution by department (with tagging assumption)
- 7 cited sources from Parallel research

### Next research priorities
1. Native App security model for cost visibility access
2. ORG_USAGE privilege requirements for multi-account apps
3. Cost Insights API (still GA-pending?)
