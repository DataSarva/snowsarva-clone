- Snowflake added new ORG-level premium views (org account) incl. `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY` and `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` (query-level compute cost attribution; up to 24h latency).
- Snowflake Native Apps “Shareback” reached GA (consumer-approved sharing back to provider/3rd parties via listings + app specs); strong enabler for opt-in FinOps app telemetry.
