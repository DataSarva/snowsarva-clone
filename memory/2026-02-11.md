- Snowflake added new ORG-level premium views (org account) incl. `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY` and `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` (query-level compute cost attribution; up to 24h latency).
- Snowflake Native Apps "Shareback" reached GA (consumer-approved sharing back to provider/3rd parties via listings + app specs); strong enabler for opt-in FinOps app telemetry.
- Snowflake server release 10.3 expanded owner’s-rights contexts (Native Apps/Streamlit/owner’s-rights stored procs) to allow most SHOW/DESCRIBE + INFORMATION_SCHEMA access (with some history-function exceptions). Captured notes at `research/native-apps/2026-02-11/2026-02-11_2103_shareback-ga-owners-rights-introspection.md`.
- **Research Digest (14:00 UTC):** Deep-dive into WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY, WAREHOUSE_EVENTS_HISTORY, and cost control capabilities. Identified 6 MVP features including idle cost reporting, warehouse events timeline viz, and budget vs actual alerting. Created research artifact at `research/finops/2026-02-11/2026-02-11_1400_warehouse-metering-lifecycle-finops.md`. Next PR candidate: Idle Cost Report view with SQL-ready query draft.
