- Checked Snowflake release notes (2026-02-06 UTC). - Notable: New ORGANIZATION_USAGE premium views incl. QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY (query-level cost attribution) + owner’s-rights contexts now allow broader SHOW/DESCRIBE and INFORMATION_SCHEMA access (Native Apps). - Notable: Notebooks in Workspaces is GA (runs on SPCS container runtime; has compute/cost mgmt knobs like idle time + EAI mgmt). - Notable: SPCS behavior change (2026_01 bundle) may snapshot block volumes on delete (billable), with opt-out `snapshotOnDelete: false`.
