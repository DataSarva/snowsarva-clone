The business logic of an application can include a Streamlit app,\nstored procedures, and functions written using [Snowpark API](../snowpark/index) ,\nJavaScript, and SQL.\nShare an application with consumers through listings. A listing can be either free or paid.\nYou can distribute and monetize your apps in the Snowflake Marketplace or distribute them to\nspecific consumers using private listings.\nInclude rich visualizations in your application using Streamlit.\nThe Snowflake Native App Framework also supports an enhanced development experience that provides:\nSection Title: ... > Introduction to the Snowflake Native App Framework [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nA streamlined testing environment where you can test your applications from a single account.\nA robust developer workflow.
