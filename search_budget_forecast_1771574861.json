          "Guides Cost & Billing Control Budgets\n\n# Monitor credit usage with budgets \u00b6\n\nA budget defines a monthly spending limit on the compute costs for\na Snowflake account or a custom group of Snowflake objects. When the spending limit is projected to be exceeded, a notification is\nsent. You can configure the budget to send this notification to a list of email addresses, a queue provided by a cloud service\n(Amazon SNS, Azure Event Grid, or Google Cloud PubSub), or a webhook for a third-party system (for example, Slack, Microsoft\nTeams, or PagerDuty).\n\n## Account budget and custom budgets \u00b6\n\nThe _account budget_ monitors spending for all credit usage in the account.\n\nYou can also create a _custom budget_ to monitor the spending limits for a specific group of supported objects .\n\nFor both types of budgets, you must set up the spending limit and specify how you want to receive notifications.\n\nTo start using budgets in Snowflake, activate the account budget .\n\n## Spending limit and time interval \u00b6\n\nThe spending limit is expressed in Snowflake credits and is used for alerting and notifications purposes only. The spending limit\nis set for the time interval of one calendar month.\n\nThe time interval starts at 12:00AM UTC on the first day of the month and ends at 11:59PM UTC on the last day of the month. If a budget\nis created after the first day of the month, the first monitoring interval is the period until the last day of the current month, then\nis reset on the first of the following month.\n\nIf you activate your _account budget_ after the first day of the month, data starting from the beginning of the month is backfilled\nand used to determine if you are going to exceed your spending limit for the month.\n\nIf you create a _custom budget_ after the first day of the month, historical data for the month is only backfilled for resources that were\nadded to the budget using a tag. Data from resources added individually are not backfilled.\n\nNote\n\nIf you create a custom budget and individually add resources to the budget instead of using a tag, consider the following:\n\n* Forecasting for future spend by those resources is based on the credit usage only for the days after the budget is enabled.\n* You might exceed your budget for the first month. Because the data for the resources is not backfilled, the forecasting might be\n  incorrect. Subsequent months will correctly forecast credit usage based on spending history.\n\n## Adjusting the budget refresh interval \u00b6\n\nA budget cannot calculate whether consumption has reached a spending limit until the budget is refreshed with the most current consumption\ndata. The time period between consumption and the budget\u2019s receipt of information about that consumption is called the\nbudget refresh interval.\n\nBy default, the budget refresh interval is up to 6.5 hours. You can reduce the budget refresh interval to one hour, which can be helpful\nwhen you need to watch spending more carefully. A budget with a one-hour refresh interval is known as a _low latency budget_ . You can\ntemporarily reduce the budget refresh interval to closely monitor consumption, and then set it back to the default to save on costs.\n\nSetting the refresh interval to one hour increases the compute cost of the budget by a factor of 12. For example, if a budget consumes one\ncredit per month when the refresh interval is 6.5 hours, then the budget consumes 12 credits per month when the refresh period is one hour.\nTo determine the current compute cost of your budgets, see Exploring compute costs .\n\n* To adjust the budget refresh interval, call the SET\\_REFRESH\\_TIER method.\n  You can also use Snowsight to adjust the interval for a custom budget by selecting or deselecting the Enable low latency budget field.\n* To retrieve the current refresh interval, call the GET\\_REFRESH\\_TIER method.\n\n## Supported services \u00b6\n\nBudgets monitor credit usage for the following services. Use the table to determine whether custom budgets support the service and which\nobject is associated with the service.\n\nNote\n\nAccount budget support for serverless features depends on the availability of\nservice types in the Account Usage METERING\\_HISTORY view view.\n\n|Service |Account budget |Custom budget |Object |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|AI\\_SERVICES |\u2714 | | |\n|AUTO\\_CLUSTERING |\u2714 |\u2714 |Table |\n|COPY\\_FILES |\u2714 |\u2714 |Database |\n|DATA\\_QUALITY\\_MONITORING |\u2714 |\u2714 |Table |\n|HYBRID\\_TABLE\\_REQUESTS |\u2714 | | |\n|MATERIALIZED\\_VIEW |\u2714 |\u2714 |Materialized view |\n|PIPE |\u2714 |\u2714 |Pipe |\n|QUERY\\_ACCELERATION |\u2714 |\u2714 |Warehouse |\n|REPLICATION |\u2714 |\u2714 |Database, Replication group |\n|SEARCH\\_OPTIMIZATION |\u2714 |\u2714 |Table |\n|SERVERLESS\\_ALERTS |\u2714 |\u2714 |Alert |\n|SERVERLESS\\_TASK |\u2714 |\u2714 |Task |\n|SNOWPARK\\_CONTAINER\\_SERVICES |\u2714 |\u2714 |Compute pool |\n|SNOWPIPE\\_STREAMING |\u2714 |\u2714 |Table |\n|WAREHOUSE\\_METERING |\u2714 |\u2714 |Warehouse |\n\n## Budgets notifications \u00b6\n\nA budget sends a daily alert notification when current spending is on track to exceed the spending limit based on time-series\nforecasting.\n\nTo receive automatic alert notifications, you must do the following as part of activating the account budget or creating a custom budget:\n\n* Set a spending limit for the budget.\n* Specify how you want to receive notifications about the budget.\n\nFor more information, see Notifications for budgets .\n\n## Budgets roles and privileges \u00b6\n\nTo enable a custom role in your account to work with budgets, you can grant the following roles and privileges.\n\nNote\n\nSnowflake provides application roles and database roles that control access to all cost-related features, including budgets. For\ninformation about granting these roles to a custom role rather than working with budget-specific roles and privileges, see Access control for cost management .\n\n### Application roles to manage the account budget \u00b6\n\nYou can grant the following application roles to a custom role in your account to monitor or manage the account budget:\n\n|Application Role |Description |\n| --- | --- |\n|BUDGET\\_VIEWER |Enables a role to view budget usage data and list the resources in the budget. |\n|BUDGET\\_ADMIN |Enables a role to activate or deactivate the account budget and modify the properties of a budget including spending limit,\nthe notification integrations to use, the list of email addresses to receive notifications, and the mute notifications\nsetting. |\n\nIn addition to the application role, there are other required privileges that must be granted to enable a custom role to monitor or manage\nthe account budget. For more information, see Required roles and privileges .\n\n### Instance roles to manage custom budgets \u00b6\n\nEach custom budget has instance roles that you can grant to other roles to view or modify the budget:\n\n|Instance Role |Description |\n| --- | --- |\n|VIEWER |Enables a role to view budget usage data. |\n|ADMIN |Enables a role to modify the properties of a budget including spending limit, the notification integrations to use, the\nlist of email addresses to receive notifications, the mute notifications setting, and the objects in the group. |\n\nIn addition to the instance role, there are other required privileges that must be granted to enable a custom role to create, monitor, or\nmodify a custom budget. For more information, see Required roles and privileges .\n\n### Required roles and privileges \u00b6\n\nIn addition to the application or instance roles, the following privileges must be granted to a custom role to monitor or manage budgets:\n\n|Privilege or role |Budget type |Create |Manage |Monitor |Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|USAGE\\_VIEWER |Both |\u2714 |\u2714 |\u2714 |Grant the Snowflake database role USAGE\\_VIEWER to the custom role. |\n|USAGE |Custom |\u2714 |\u2714 |\u2714 |Grant the USAGE privilege on the database or schema that contains the custom budget. |\n|SNOWFLAKE.BUDGET\\_CREATOR |Custom |\u2714 | | |Grant this database role to the custom role to enable it to create custom budgets. |\n|CREATE SNOWFLAKE.CORE.BUDGET |Custom |\u2714 | | |Grant this privilege on the schema that will contain the custom budget. |\n|APPLYBUDGET |Custom | |\u2714 | |Must be granted on each object to be added or removed from a custom budget. |\n|USAGE |Custom | |\u2714 | |To add or remove schema objects from a custom budget, this privilege must be granted on the database and schema that contains\nthe object. |\n\nFor more information and examples, see the following sections:\n\n* Create a custom role to manage the account budget\n* Create a custom role to monitor the account budget\n* Create a custom role to monitor a custom budget\n* Create a custom role to manage a custom budget\n* Create a custom role to create budgets\n\n## Limitations \u00b6\n\nThe following are limitations for Budgets:\n\n* Instances of the BUDGET class can\u2019t be replicated to target accounts.\n* An account can contain a maximum of 100 custom budgets.\n* Currently, Budgets does not support monitoring costs for Hybrid tables .\n* The following account-level parameters must be unset or set to the default value:\n  \n    + AUTOCOMMIT must be unset or set to TRUE.\n        \n        If this parameter is set to FALSE, activating a budget might fail, or usage might not be tracked correctly.\n    + TIMESTAMP\\_INPUT\\_FORMAT and DATE\\_INPUT\\_FORMAT must be unset or set to AUTO.\n        \n        If these parameters aren\u2019t set to AUTO, usage might not be tracked correctly.\n  \n  Before you activate budgets, check the values of these parameters by executing the SHOW PARAMETERS command:\n  \n  ```\n  SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'AUTOCOMMIT' IN ACCOUNT ;\n  ```\n  \n  Copy\n  \n  ```\n  SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'TIMESTAMP_INPUT_FORMAT' IN ACCOUNT ;\n  ```\n  \n  Copy\n  \n  ```\n  SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'DATE_INPUT_FORMAT' IN ACCOUNT ;\n  ```\n  \n  Copy\n  \n  Note\n  \n  You must set these parameters at the account level. Setting the parameters at a lower level (for example, at the session\n  level) doesn\u2019t have an effect on activating budgets or tracking usage.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)"

A virtual warehouse consumes Snowflake credits while it runs. You can use a resource monitor\nto monitor credit usage by virtual warehouses and the cloud services needed to support those warehouses. You can also set up a resource\nmonitor to suspend a user-managed virtual warehouse when it reaches a credit limit.\nImportant\nResource monitors work for warehouses only. You can\u2019t use a resource monitor to track spending associated with serverless\nfeatures and AI services. To monitor credit consumption by these features, use a budget instead.\nThe number of credits consumed depends on the size of the warehouse and how long it runs. For more information on warehouse credit usage,\nsee Virtual warehouse credit usage .\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6\nContent:\nCredit usage limits can be set for a specified interval or date range. When a limit is reached and/or reaches a specified threshold,\nthe resource monitor can trigger various actions, such as sending alert notifications and/or suspending user-managed warehouses.\nOnly users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create a resource monitor, but an account administrator can grant privileges to other roles\nto allow other users to view and modify resource monitors.\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6\nContent:\nA resource monitor is a first-class object in Snowflake, consisting of the following properties:\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Credit quota \u00b6\nContent:\nCredit quota specifies the number of Snowflake credits allocated to the monitor for the specified frequency interval. Any number can be specified.\nIn addition, Snowflake tracks the *used credits/quota* within the specified frequency interval by all warehouses assigned to the monitor.\nAt the specified interval, this number resets to `0` .\nCredit quota accounts for credits consumed by both user-managed virtual warehouses and virtual warehouses used by cloud services.\nFor example, your resource monitor limit is set at 1000 credits. If your warehouse consumes 700 credits, and cloud services consume 300\ncredits within a specified interval or date range, an alert will be triggered.\nNote\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Credit quota \u00b6\nContent:\nResource monitor limits do not take into account the daily 10% adjustment for cloud services. Snowflake uses all credit consumption by\nthe cloud services layer to calculate whether a limit has been reached, even if that consumption is never billed. For more information\nabout how cloud services credits and adjustments are calculated, see Understanding billing for cloud services usage .\nFor instructions on how to view your cloud services credit usage, see Exploring compute cost .\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Monitor type \u00b6\nContent:\nThis property specifies whether the resource monitor is used to monitor your account or a specific set of individual warehouses:\nAn *account monitor* monitors the credit usage of all the warehouses in the account. An account can only have one account monitor.\nA *warehouse monitor* monitors the credit usage of the warehouses assigned to the resource monitor. An account can have multiple\nwarehouse monitors.A warehouse monitor can have one or more warehouses assigned to it, but each warehouse can only be assigned to one resource monitor.\nIf this property is not set, the resource monitor doesn\u2019t monitor any credit usage. It simply remains dormant.\nFor more information, see Assignment of resource monitors .\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nThe default schedule for a resource monitor specifies that it starts monitoring credit usage immediately and the used credits reset to `0` at the beginning of each calendar month (i.e. the start of the standard Snowflake billing cycle).\nHowever, you can optionally customize the schedule for a resource monitor using the following properties:\nFrequency :\nThe interval at which the used credits reset relative to the specified start date.\nSupported values:\nDaily\nWeekly\nMonthly\nYearly\nNever (used credits never reset; assigned warehouses continue using credits until the credit quota is reached)\nStart :\nDate and time (i.e. timestamp) when the resource monitor starts monitoring the assigned warehouses.\nSupported values:\nImmediately (i.e. current timestamp)\nLater (i.e. any future timestamp)\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nIn addition, Snowflake uses this date to determine when to reset the used credits, based on the specified frequency. Note, however, that\nregardless of the time specified in the start date and time, resource monitors reset at 12:00 AM UTC. For example, if the start is\n15-July-2019 (Monday) at 8:00 AM:\nFrequency = Monthly: Used credits reset at 12:00 AM UTC on the 15th of each following month.\nFrequency = Weekly: Used credits reset at 12:00 AM UTC on each following Monday.\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nNote that, if you specify the last day of a month as the start date, Snowflake resets the used credits on the last day of all following\nmonths, regardless of the number of days in the month. For example, if you set the start date to January 31, Snowflake subsequently resets\nthe used credits for the resource monitor on February 28 (or February 29 in a leap year), March 31, April 30, and so on.\nEnd :\nDate and time (i.e. timestamp) when Snowflake suspends the warehouses associated with the resource monitor, regardless of whether the\nused credits reached any of the thresholds defined for the resource monitor\u2019s actions (see the next section in this topic).\nSupported values: Any future timestamp.\nNote that this property is not commonly used.\nImportant\nIf you choose to customize the schedule for a resource monitor, the frequency is relative to the specified start date, which is\ndifferent than the default schedule.\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Assignment of resource monitors \u00b6\nContent:\nAn account-level resource monitor does not override resource monitor assignment for individual warehouses. If either the account\nresource monitor or the warehouse resource monitor reaches its defined threshold and a suspend action has been defined, the warehouse is\nsuspended.\nAn account-level resource monitor does not control credit usage by the Snowflake-provided compute resources for serverless features (for\nexample, Snowpipe, automatic reclustering, and materialized views).\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Warehouse suspension and resumption \u00b6\nContent:\nA warehouse-level resource monitor can monitor, but cannot suspend, credit usage by cloud services. After a virtual warehouse is\nsuspended, subsequent queries run against that warehouse can still result in additional cloud services costs. For more information\nabout credit usage for cloud services, see Cloud service credit usage .\nTip\nResource monitors are not intended for strictly controlling consumption on an hourly basis; they are intended for tracking and\ncontrolling credit consumption per interval (day, week, month, etc.). Also, they are not intended for setting precise limits on credit\nusage (i.e. down to the level of individual credits). For example, when credit quota thresholds are reached for a resource monitor, the\nassigned warehouses may take some time to suspend, even when the action is **Suspend Immediate** , thereby consuming additional credits.\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > DDL for resource monitors \u00b6\nContent:\nSnowflake provides the following DDL commands for creating and using/managing resource monitors:\nCREATE RESOURCE MONITOR\nALTER RESOURCE MONITOR\nSHOW RESOURCE MONITORS\nDROP RESOURCE MONITOR\nIn addition, the following DDL commands can be used to assign a resource monitor to a warehouse and determine whether a warehouse is assigned to\na monitor:\nCREATE WAREHOUSE or ALTER WAREHOUSE\nSHOW WAREHOUSES\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > ... > Creating a resource monitor with a default schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nExecute a CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR command, but do not specify any scheduling properties.\nExecute an ALTER WAREHOUSE statement to assign warehouses to the resource monitor or an ALTER ACCOUNT statement to set the resource monitor for the account.\nFor example:\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Setting a resource monitor for your account \u00b6\nContent:\nTo change the monitor type of an existing resource monitor from a warehouse monitor to an account monitor, see the example in the Modifying a Resource Monitor section .\nTo view whether a resource monitor is set for your account, use the web interface or the SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS command. The `LEVEL` column for a resource monitor displays whether it is set for your account or individual warehouses.\nImportant\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Setting a resource monitor for your account \u00b6\nContent:\nAn account-level resource monitor only controls the virtual warehouses explicitly created in your account; it does not control credit\nusage by the Snowflake-provided warehouses for serverless features (for example, Snowpipe , Automatic Clustering , and materialized views ).\nA warehouse-level resource monitor can monitor, but cannot suspend, credit usage by cloud services. The monitor can only\nsuspend the user-managed virtual warehouses created in your account. After a user-managed virtual warehouse is suspended, subsequent\nqueries run against that warehouse can still result in additional cloud services costs. For more information about credit usage for cloud\nservices, see Cloud service credit usage .\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Viewing resource monitors \u00b6\nContent:\nIn addition, using any role, you can execute a SHOW WAREHOUSES statement to view the warehouses owned\nby the role (or for which the role has been granted USAGE privilege). The output includes the resource monitor, if any, to which\nthe warehouse is assigned.\nNote\nFor provider accounts that have created reader accounts, Snowflake provides an additional view, RESOURCE_MONITORS . This view can be used for querying resource monitor usage\nin the provider\u2019s reader accounts. For more information, see Account Usage .\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Replicating resource monitors \u00b6\nContent:\nBusiness Critical Feature\nResource monitor replication requires Business Critical (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support) .\nResource monitors can be replicated from a source account to target accounts using a replication or failover group .

If you are only concerned\nwith controlling the costs of warehouses, you can also use resource monitors to monitor and suspend warehouses. In addition, Snowflake\nprovides cost controls you can configure to help avoid unexpected costs.\n\n## Use budgets to control credit usage \u00b6\n\nA _budget_ allows you to set a monthly spending limit and monitor the credit usage of all supported objects and serverless features in your account. In addition to your account budget,\nyou can create custom budgets to monitor credit usage of groups of specified objects and the serverless features used by those objects.\nFor example, you can create a custom budget for each department in your organization. Each budget sends a notification if the\ncredit usage is expected to exceed its spending limit for the month. You can configure the budget to send this notification to a\nlist of email addresses, a queue provided by a cloud service (Amazon SNS, Azure Event Grid, or Google Cloud PubSub), or a webhook\nfor a third-party system (for example, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or PagerDuty).\n\nFor information about budgets, see Monitor credit usage with budgets .\n\n## Use resource monitors to control credit usage \u00b6\n\nA _resource monitor_ lets you monitor credit usage by user-managed virtual warehouses. You can set a spending limit that resets on a\nmonthly basis or on a custom schedule. A resource monitor can\nsend an email notification when your credit usage reaches a percentage (threshold) of the spending limit. You can customize up to five\nnotification thresholds. To help avoid unexpected credit usage, you can optionally suspend a warehouse when its credit usage reaches\na threshold.\n\nFor background information about how virtual warehouses incur costs, see Understanding compute cost .\n\nFor information about resource monitors, see Working with resource monitors .\n\n## Cost controls for warehouses \u00b6\n\nFor a set of best practices that act as cost controls for virtual warehouses, see Cost controls for warehouses .\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

After you activate the account\nbudget, you can set the spending limit for the account and configure how notifications are sent when credit usage is\nexpected to exceed the spending limit. Notifications begin when projected spending is more than 10% above the spending limit.\n\nYou can activate the account budget by using Snowsight or by executing SQL statements.\n\nThe next sections explain how to activate the account budget:\n\n* Create a custom role to manage the account budget\n* Use Snowsight to activate the account budget\n* Use SQL commands to activate the account budget\n\n### Create a custom role to manage the account budget \u00b6\n\nYou can create a custom role to activate and modify the account budget. A user who is granted this role can administer the budget by taking\nthe following actions on the account budget:\n\n* Activate and deactivate the account budget.\n* Set the spending limit.\n* Edit notification settings.\n* Monitor credit usage for the account.\n\nFor a full list of roles and privileges required for the budget administrator role, see Budgets roles and privileges .\n\nThe following example creates a role named `account_budget_admin` and grants the role the ability to monitor and manage the\naccount budget:\n\n```\nUSE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN ; \n\n CREATE ROLE account_budget_admin ; \n\n GRANT APPLICATION ROLE SNOWFLAKE.BUDGET_ADMIN TO ROLE account_budget_admin ; \n\n GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE account_budget_admin ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\n### Use Snowsight to activate the account budget \u00b6\n\nNote\n\nOnly a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role or a role granted account budget admin privileges can activate and set up the account budget for a regular\naccount.\n\nIf you are activating the account budget for the organization account , use the GLOBALORGADMIN\nrole instead of the ACCOUNTADMIN role.\n\n2. In the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Cost management .\n3. Select Budgets .\n4. If prompted, select a warehouse.\n5. In the dashboard, select Set up Account Budget .\n6. Enter the target spending limit for the account.\n7. Enter the email addresses to receive notification emails.\n   \n   Note\n   \n   Each email address added for budget notifications must be verified . The\n   notification email setup fails if any email address in the list is _not_ verified.\n8. Select Finish Setup .\n\n### Use SQL commands to activate the account budget \u00b6\n\nNote\n\nOnly a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role or a role granted account budget admin privileges can activate and set up the account budget in a regular\naccount.\n\nIf you are activating the account budget for the organization account , use the GLOBALORGADMIN\nrole instead of the ACCOUNTADMIN role.\n\n1. Activate the account budget by calling the account\\_root\\_budget!ACTIVATE method on the\n   SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL.ACCOUNT\\_ROOT\\_BUDGET object:\n   \n   ```\n   CALL SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL.ACCOUNT_ROOT_BUDGET ! ACTIVATE ();\n   ```\n   \n   Copy\n2. Set the spending limit calling the <budget\\_name>!SET\\_SPENDING\\_LIMIT method:\n   \n   ```\n   CALL SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL.ACCOUNT_ROOT_BUDGET ! SET_SPENDING_LIMIT ( 1000 );\n   ```\n   \n   Copy\n3. Set up notifications for the budget so that you receive notifications when your credit usage is expected to exceed your\n   spending limits.\n   \n   See Notifications for budgets .\n\n## Deactivating the account budget \u00b6\n\nYou can deactivate the account budget using Snowsight or SQL.\n\nDeactivating the account budget resets the account budget to its state before activation:\n\n* All historical account budget data is deleted.\n* The background measurement task for the account budget is suspended.\n* The account budget settings for spending limit and email notifications are reset.\n\nAccount budget deactivation does not affect custom budgets.

For example, you\nmight want to receive a notification when:\nThe warehouse credit usage increases by a specified percentage of your current quota.\nThe resource consumption for your pipelines, tasks, materialized views, etc. increases beyond a specified amount.\nYour data fails to comply with a particular business rule that you have set up.\nTo do this, you can set up a Snowflake alert. A Snowflake alert is a schema-level object that specifies:\nA condition that triggers the alert (e.g. the presence of queries that take longer than a second to complete).\nThe action to perform when the condition is met (e.g. send an email notification, capture some data in a table, etc.).\nWhen and how often the condition should be evaluated (e.g. every 24 hours, every Sunday at midnight, etc.).\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Introduction \u00b6\nContent:\nFor example, suppose that you want to send an email notification when the credit consumption exceeds a certain limit for a\nwarehouse. Suppose that you want to check for this every 30 minutes. You can create an alert with the following properties:\nCondition: The credit consumption for a warehouse (the sum of the `credits_used` column in the WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE ) schema exceeds a specified limit.\nAction: Email the administrator.\nFrequency / schedule: Check for this condition every 30 minutes.\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Choosing the type of alert \u00b6\nContent:\nYou can create the following types of alerts:\nAlert on a schedule : Snowflake evaluates the condition against the existing data on a\nscheduled basis.For example, you can set up a alert on a schedule to check if any of the existing rows in a table has a column value that\nexceeds a specified amount.\nAlert on new data : Snowflake evaluates the condition against any new rows in a specified\ntable or a view.For example, you can set up an alert on new data to notify you when new rows for error messages are inserted into the event table for your account. Because dynamic table refreshes\nand task executions log events to the event table, you can set up an alert on new data to:\nMonitor dynamic table refreshes .\nMonitor task executions .\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Using the serverless compute model (serverless alerts) \u00b6\nContent:\nAlerts that use the serverless compute model called *serverless alerts* . If you use the serverless compute model, Snowflake\nautomatically resizes and scales the compute resources required for the alert. Snowflake determines the ideal size of the compute\nresources for a given run based on a dynamic analysis of statistics for the most recent previous runs of the same alert. The\nmaximum size for a serverless alert run is equivalent to an XXLARGE warehouse. Multiple workloads in your account share a common\nset of compute resources.\nBilling is similar to other serverless features (such as serverless tasks). See Understanding the costs of alerts .\nNote\nIf you are creating an alert on new data that is added infrequently, consider\nconfiguring this as a serverless alert. If you configure the alert to use a warehouse instead, even a simple action that sends\nan email notification incurs at least one minute of warehouse cost.\n ... \nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Understanding the costs of alerts \u00b6\nContent:\nThe costs associated with running an alert to execute SQL code differ depending on the compute resources used for the alert:\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Understanding the costs of alerts \u00b6\nContent:\nFor serverless alerts, Snowflake bills your account based on compute resource usage. Charges are calculated based on your\ntotal usage of the resources, including cloud service usage, measured in *compute-hours* credit usage. The compute-hours cost\nchanges based on warehouse size and query runtime. For more information, see Serverless credit usage .To learn how many credits are consumed by alerts, refer to the \u201cServerless Feature Credit Table\u201d in\nthe [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) .To view the usage history of serverless alerts, you can:\nCall the SERVERLESS_ALERT_HISTORY function. Query the SERVERLESS_ALERT_HISTORY view . For alerts that use a virtual warehouse that you specify, Snowflake bills your account for credit usage based on the warehouse usage when an alert is running.\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Understanding the costs of alerts \u00b6\nContent:\nThis is\nsimilar to the warehouse usage for executing the same SQL statements in a client or Snowsight. Per-second credit\nbilling and warehouse auto-suspend give you the flexibility to start with larger warehouse sizes and then adjust the size to\nmatch your alert workloads.\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Understanding the costs of alerts \u00b6\nContent:\nTip\nIf you want to set up an alert that evaluates new rows added to a table or view, use an alert on new data , rather than an alert on a schedule. An alert on a schedule will\nexecute at a scheduled time, regardless of whether or not new rows have been inserted.\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Granting the privileges to create alerts \u00b6\nContent:\nIn order to create an alert, you must use a role that has the following privileges:\nThe EXECUTE ALERT privilege on the account.NoteThis privilege can only be granted by a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role.\nOne of the following privileges:\nThe EXECUTE MANAGED ALERT privilege on the account, if you are creating a serverless alert.\nThe USAGE privilege on the warehouse used to execute the alert, if you are specifying a virtual warehouse for the alert.\nThe USAGE and CREATE ALERT privileges on the schema in which you want to create the alert.\nThe USAGE privilege on the database containing the schema.\nThe SELECT privilege on the table or view that you want to query in the alert condition (if you are creating an alert on new data ).\nTo grant these privileges to a role, use the GRANT  \u2026 TO ROLE command.\n ... \nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Creating an alert \u00b6\nContent:\nThe following sections provide the basic steps and an example of creating different types of alerts:\nCreating an alert on a schedule\nCreating an alert on new data\n ... \nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > ... > Creating an alert on new data \u00b6\nContent:\nSuppose that you want to receive an email notification when a stored procedure named `my_stored_proc` in the database and\nschema `my_db.my_schema` logs a FATAL message to the active event table for your account .\nTo create an alert named `my_alert` that does this:\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > ... > Creating an alert on new data \u00b6\nContent:\nFind the name of the active event table for your account:Copy\nEnable change tracking on the table or view that you plan to query in the alert\ncondition.Copy\nSet up a notification integration for sending email . Verify that you are using a role that has the privileges to create an alert .If you are not using that role, execute the USE ROLE command to use that role. Verify that you are using database and schema in which you plan to create the alert.If you are not using that database and schema, execute the USE DATABASE and USE SCHEMA commands to use that database and schema. Execute the CREATE ALERT command to create the alert, and omit the SCHEDULE parameter.For example, the following example creates an alert on new data that monitors the event table for errors in dynamic table\nrefreshes and sends a notification to a Slack channel.\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > ... > Creating an alert on new data \u00b6\nContent:\nThe example assumes the following:CopyIf you want to create a serverless alert, omit the WAREHOUSE parameter:CopyFor the full description of the CREATE ALERT command, refer to CREATE ALERT .NoteWhen you create an alert, the alert is suspended by default. You must resume the newly created alert in order for the alert\nto execute. Your active event table is the default event table (SNOWFLAKE.TELEMETRY.EVENTS). You have set the severity level to capture events for your dynamic\ntable. You have set up a webhook notification integration for that Slack\nchannel. Resume the alert by executing the ALTER ALERT \u2026 RESUME command. For example:Copy\n ... \nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Specifying timestamps based on alert schedules \u00b6\nContent:\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE ALERT alert_new_rows \n  WAREHOUSE = my_warehouse \n  SCHEDULE = '1 MINUTE' \n  IF ( EXISTS ( \n      SELECT * \n      FROM my_table \n      WHERE row_timestamp BETWEEN SNOWFLAKE.ALERT.LAST_SUCCESSFUL_SCHEDULED_TIME () \n       AND SNOWFLAKE.ALERT.SCHEDULED_TIME () \n  )) \n  THEN CALL SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL (...);\n```\nCopy\n ... \nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Viewing details about an alert \u00b6\nContent:\nTo list the alerts that have been created in an account, database, or schema, execute the SHOW ALERTS command. For example, to list the alerts that were created in the current schema, run the following command:\n```\nSHOW ALERTS ;\n```\nCopy\nThis command lists the alerts that you own and the alerts that you have the MONITOR or OPERATE privilege on.\nTo view the details about a specific alert, execute the DESCRIBE ALERT command. For example:\n```\nDESC ALERT my_alert ;\n```\nCopy\nNote\nIf you are not the owner of the alert, you must have the MONITOR or OPERATE privilege on the alert to view the details of the\nalert.\n ... \nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Monitoring the execution of alerts \u00b6\nContent:\nTo monitor the execution of the alerts, you can:\nCheck the results of the action that was specified for the alert. For example, if the action inserted rows into a table, you can\ncheck the table for new rows.\nView the history of alert executions by using one of the following:\nThe ALERT_HISTORY table function in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema.For example, to view the executions of alerts over the past hour, execute the following statement:Copy\nThe ALERT_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema in the shared\nSNOWFLAKE database.\nIn the query history, the name of the user who executed the query will be SYSTEM. (The alerts are run by the system service .)\nSection Title: Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake \u00b6 > Viewing the query history of a serverless alert \u00b6\nContent:\nTo view the query history of a serverless alert, you must be the owner of the alert, or you must use a role that has the\nMONITOR or OPERATE privilege on the alert itself. (This differs from alerts that use one your warehouses, which require the\nMONITOR or OPERATOR privilege on the warehouse.)\nFor example, suppose that you want to use the `my_alert_role` role when viewing the query history of the alert `my_alert` .\nIf `my_alert_role` is not the owner of `my_alert` , you must grant that role the\nMONITOR or OPERATE privilege on the alert:\n```\nGRANT MONITOR ON ALERT my_alert TO ROLE my_alert_role ;\n```\nCopy\nAfter the role is granted this privilege, you can use the role to view the query history of the alert:\n```\nUSE ROLE my_alert_role ;\n```\nCopy"

If you are only concerned\nwith controlling the costs of warehouses, you can also use resource monitors to monitor and suspend warehouses. In addition, Snowflake\nprovides cost controls you can configure to help avoid unexpected costs.\n\n## Use budgets to control credit usage \u00b6\n\nA _budget_ allows you to set a monthly spending limit and monitor the credit usage of all supported objects and serverless features in your account. In addition to your account budget,\nyou can create custom budgets to monitor credit usage of groups of specified objects and the serverless features used by those objects.\nFor example, you can create a custom budget for each department in your organization. Each budget sends a notification if the\ncredit usage is expected to exceed its spending limit for the month. You can configure the budget to send this notification to a\nlist of email addresses, a queue provided by a cloud service (Amazon SNS, Azure Event Grid, or Google Cloud PubSub), or a webhook\nfor a third-party system (for example, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or PagerDuty).\n\nFor information about budgets, see Monitor credit usage with budgets .\n\n## Use resource monitors to control credit usage \u00b6\n\nA _resource monitor_ lets you monitor credit usage by user-managed virtual warehouses. You can set a spending limit that resets on a\nmonthly basis or on a custom schedule. A resource monitor can\nsend an email notification when your credit usage reaches a percentage (threshold) of the spending limit. You can customize up to five\nnotification thresholds. To help avoid unexpected credit usage, you can optionally suspend a warehouse when its credit usage reaches\na threshold.\n\nFor background information about how virtual warehouses incur costs, see Understanding compute cost .\n\nFor information about resource monitors, see Working with resource monitors .\n\n## Cost controls for warehouses \u00b6\n\nFor a set of best practices that act as cost controls for virtual warehouses, see Cost controls for warehouses .\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

Snowflake uses an algorithm to\nautomatically detect these cost anomalies based on prior levels of consumption, which simplifies the process of identifying spikes or dips\nin costs so you can find ways to optimize your spend. Snowflake also provides tools to investigate these cost anomalies to identify root\ncauses.\nNote\nThe algorithm that detects cost anomalies requires at least 30 days of consumption before it can identify anomalies. If your consumption\nin the last seven days was less than 10 credits, Snowflake does not identify changes as an anomaly.\nSection Title: Introduction to cost anomalies \u00b6 > Account-level vs. organization-level cost anomalies \u00b6\nContent:\nAn account-level cost anomaly occurs when the consumption in a single account falls outside the expected range of consumption for that\naccount.\nAn organization-level cost anomaly occurs when the consumption in the entire organization falls outside the expected range of consumption\nfor the organization. It is based on the aggregate consumption of all accounts in the organization. For example, if there is a significant\nconsumption spike in one account, but a dip in another, the two might offset each other such that it is not flagged as an organization-level\nanomaly. To help investigate organization-level anomalies, Snowflake provides tools to identify which accounts had the biggest increase or\ndecrease in consumption on a specific day.\nTo identify and investigate organization-level cost anomalies, you need to be signed in to the organization account or an ORGADMIN-enabled account .\nSection Title: Introduction to cost anomalies \u00b6 > Get started \u00b6\nContent:\nTo identify and investigate cost anomalies using a user interface:\nIn the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Cost management , and then select Anomalies .\n ... \nSection Title: Introduction to cost anomalies \u00b6 > ... > Your Privacy > Strictly Necessary Cookies\nContent:\nAlways Active\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off.

They don\u2019t surface inefficient queries, runaway workloads, or which teams and users are driving the spike.\nSnowflake also doesn\u2019t automatically map warehouse or query usage to business units, cost centers, or environments. This makes accurate cost allocation slow, manual, and often incomplete.\nIf you want to track Snowflake alongside the rest of your cloud ecosystem such as AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, or other SaaS data tools, native Snowflake features cannot provide unified visibility.\nFor organizations with multiple teams, fast-growing workloads, or high Snowflake usage, native tools cannot deliver the visibility, automation, or intelligence required to proactively manage spend.\nA third-party Snowflake cost management platform fills those gaps by offering:\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Can I just use Snowflake native cost tools?\nContent:\n**Full cost visibility and attribution** across teams and workloads\n**Intelligent forecasting** that predicts spend before it spikes\n**Automated alerts and anomaly detection** that highlight issues in real time\nIn short, Snowflake shows you what you spent. A third-party Snowflake management tool explains why it happened and how to reduce it.\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > ... > 1. Ternary\nContent:\nTernary is a multi-cloud FinOps platform. It gives you cost visibility and control across cloud and SaaS solutions, including Snowflake.\nTernary\u2019s [Snowflake insights](https://ternary.app/integrations/snowflake/) shows you query counts, run times, and the type and number of credits used over a given period, broken down by account and warehouses. With these insights, you can easily spot inefficiencies that don\u2019t become obvious from a billing summary alone.\nFor example, if someone accidentally overprovisions a warehouse or if query performance starts dragging due to underprovisioning, Ternary will bring both to your attention.\nWith [Ternary\u2019s reporting engine](https://ternary.app/platform/finops-reporting-engine/) you can build custom Snowflake reports for specific teams or business units easily. You can also allocate costs to the appropriate areas of your organization to determine the total cost of ownership accurately.\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > ... > 1.

          "Guides Cost & Billing Control Budgets\n\n# Monitor credit usage with budgets \u00b6\n\nA budget defines a monthly spending limit on the compute costs for\na Snowflake account or a custom group of Snowflake objects. When the spending limit is projected to be exceeded, a notification is\nsent. You can configure the budget to send this notification to a list of email addresses, a queue provided by a cloud service\n(Amazon SNS, Azure Event Grid, or Google Cloud PubSub), or a webhook for a third-party system (for example, Slack, Microsoft\nTeams, or PagerDuty).\n\n## Account budget and custom budgets \u00b6\n\nThe _account budget_ monitors spending for all credit usage in the account.\n\nYou can also create a _custom budget_ to monitor the spending limits for a specific group of supported objects .\n\nFor both types of budgets, you must set up the spending limit and specify how you want to receive notifications.\n\nTo start using budgets in Snowflake, activate the account budget .\n\n## Spending limit and time interval \u00b6\n\nThe spending limit is expressed in Snowflake credits and is used for alerting and notifications purposes only. The spending limit\nis set for the time interval of one calendar month.\n\nThe time interval starts at 12:00AM UTC on the first day of the month and ends at 11:59PM UTC on the last day of the month. If a budget\nis created after the first day of the month, the first monitoring interval is the period until the last day of the current month, then\nis reset on the first of the following month.\n\nIf you activate your _account budget_ after the first day of the month, data starting from the beginning of the month is backfilled\nand used to determine if you are going to exceed your spending limit for the month.\n\nIf you create a _custom budget_ after the first day of the month, historical data for the month is only backfilled for resources that were\nadded to the budget using a tag. Data from resources added individually are not backfilled.\n\nNote\n\nIf you create a custom budget and individually add resources to the budget instead of using a tag, consider the following:\n\n* Forecasting for future spend by those resources is based on the credit usage only for the days after the budget is enabled.\n* You might exceed your budget for the first month. Because the data for the resources is not backfilled, the forecasting might be\n  incorrect. Subsequent months will correctly forecast credit usage based on spending history.\n\n## Adjusting the budget refresh interval \u00b6\n\nA budget cannot calculate whether consumption has reached a spending limit until the budget is refreshed with the most current consumption\ndata. The time period between consumption and the budget\u2019s receipt of information about that consumption is called the\nbudget refresh interval.\n\nBy default, the budget refresh interval is up to 6.5 hours. You can reduce the budget refresh interval to one hour, which can be helpful\nwhen you need to watch spending more carefully. A budget with a one-hour refresh interval is known as a _low latency budget_ . You can\ntemporarily reduce the budget refresh interval to closely monitor consumption, and then set it back to the default to save on costs.\n\nSetting the refresh interval to one hour increases the compute cost of the budget by a factor of 12. For example, if a budget consumes one\ncredit per month when the refresh interval is 6.5 hours, then the budget consumes 12 credits per month when the refresh period is one hour.\nTo determine the current compute cost of your budgets, see Exploring compute costs .\n\n* To adjust the budget refresh interval, call the SET\\_REFRESH\\_TIER method.\n  You can also use Snowsight to adjust the interval for a custom budget by selecting or deselecting the Enable low latency budget field.\n* To retrieve the current refresh interval, call the GET\\_REFRESH\\_TIER method.\n\n## Supported services \u00b6\n\nBudgets monitor credit usage for the following services. Use the table to determine whether custom budgets support the service and which\nobject is associated with the service.\n\nNote\n\nAccount budget support for serverless features depends on the availability of\nservice types in the Account Usage METERING\\_HISTORY view view.\n\n|Service |Account budget |Custom budget |Object |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|AI\\_SERVICES |\u2714 | | |\n|AUTO\\_CLUSTERING |\u2714 |\u2714 |Table |\n|COPY\\_FILES |\u2714 |\u2714 |Database |\n|DATA\\_QUALITY\\_MONITORING |\u2714 |\u2714 |Table |\n|HYBRID\\_TABLE\\_REQUESTS |\u2714 | | |\n|MATERIALIZED\\_VIEW |\u2714 |\u2714 |Materialized view |\n|PIPE |\u2714 |\u2714 |Pipe |\n|QUERY\\_ACCELERATION |\u2714 |\u2714 |Warehouse |\n|REPLICATION |\u2714 |\u2714 |Database, Replication group |\n|SEARCH\\_OPTIMIZATION |\u2714 |\u2714 |Table |\n|SERVERLESS\\_ALERTS |\u2714 |\u2714 |Alert |\n|SERVERLESS\\_TASK |\u2714 |\u2714 |Task |\n|SNOWPARK\\_CONTAINER\\_SERVICES |\u2714 |\u2714 |Compute pool |\n|SNOWPIPE\\_STREAMING |\u2714 |\u2714 |Table |\n|WAREHOUSE\\_METERING |\u2714 |\u2714 |Warehouse |\n\n## Budgets notifications \u00b6\n\nA budget sends a daily alert notification when current spending is on track to exceed the spending limit based on time-series\nforecasting.\n\nTo receive automatic alert notifications, you must do the following as part of activating the account budget or creating a custom budget:\n\n* Set a spending limit for the budget.\n* Specify how you want to receive notifications about the budget.\n\nFor more information, see Notifications for budgets .\n\n## Budgets roles and privileges \u00b6\n\nTo enable a custom role in your account to work with budgets, you can grant the following roles and privileges.\n\nNote\n\nSnowflake provides application roles and database roles that control access to all cost-related features, including budgets. For\ninformation about granting these roles to a custom role rather than working with budget-specific roles and privileges, see Access control for cost management .\n\n### Application roles to manage the account budget \u00b6\n\nYou can grant the following application roles to a custom role in your account to monitor or manage the account budget:\n\n|Application Role |Description |\n| --- | --- |\n|BUDGET\\_VIEWER |Enables a role to view budget usage data and list the resources in the budget. |\n|BUDGET\\_ADMIN |Enables a role to activate or deactivate the account budget and modify the properties of a budget including spending limit,\nthe notification integrations to use, the list of email addresses to receive notifications, and the mute notifications\nsetting. |\n\nIn addition to the application role, there are other required privileges that must be granted to enable a custom role to monitor or manage\nthe account budget. For more information, see Required roles and privileges .\n\n### Instance roles to manage custom budgets \u00b6\n\nEach custom budget has instance roles that you can grant to other roles to view or modify the budget:\n\n|Instance Role |Description |\n| --- | --- |\n|VIEWER |Enables a role to view budget usage data. |\n|ADMIN |Enables a role to modify the properties of a budget including spending limit, the notification integrations to use, the\nlist of email addresses to receive notifications, the mute notifications setting, and the objects in the group. |\n\nIn addition to the instance role, there are other required privileges that must be granted to enable a custom role to create, monitor, or\nmodify a custom budget. For more information, see Required roles and privileges .\n\n### Required roles and privileges \u00b6\n\nIn addition to the application or instance roles, the following privileges must be granted to a custom role to monitor or manage budgets:\n\n|Privilege or role |Budget type |Create |Manage |Monitor |Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|USAGE\\_VIEWER |Both |\u2714 |\u2714 |\u2714 |Grant the Snowflake database role USAGE\\_VIEWER to the custom role. |\n|USAGE |Custom |\u2714 |\u2714 |\u2714 |Grant the USAGE privilege on the database or schema that contains the custom budget. |\n|SNOWFLAKE.BUDGET\\_CREATOR |Custom |\u2714 | | |Grant this database role to the custom role to enable it to create custom budgets. |\n|CREATE SNOWFLAKE.CORE.BUDGET |Custom |\u2714 | | |Grant this privilege on the schema that will contain the custom budget. |\n|APPLYBUDGET |Custom | |\u2714 | |Must be granted on each object to be added or removed from a custom budget. |\n|USAGE |Custom | |\u2714 | |To add or remove schema objects from a custom budget, this privilege must be granted on the database and schema that contains\nthe object. |\n\nFor more information and examples, see the following sections:\n\n* Create a custom role to manage the account budget\n* Create a custom role to monitor the account budget\n* Create a custom role to monitor a custom budget\n* Create a custom role to manage a custom budget\n* Create a custom role to create budgets\n\n## Limitations \u00b6\n\nThe following are limitations for Budgets:\n\n* Instances of the BUDGET class can\u2019t be replicated to target accounts.\n* An account can contain a maximum of 100 custom budgets.\n* Currently, Budgets does not support monitoring costs for Hybrid tables .\n* The following account-level parameters must be unset or set to the default value:\n  \n    + AUTOCOMMIT must be unset or set to TRUE.\n        \n        If this parameter is set to FALSE, activating a budget might fail, or usage might not be tracked correctly.\n    + TIMESTAMP\\_INPUT\\_FORMAT and DATE\\_INPUT\\_FORMAT must be unset or set to AUTO.\n        \n        If these parameters aren\u2019t set to AUTO, usage might not be tracked correctly.\n  \n  Before you activate budgets, check the values of these parameters by executing the SHOW PARAMETERS command:\n  \n  ```\n  SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'AUTOCOMMIT' IN ACCOUNT ;\n  ```\n  \n  Copy\n  \n  ```\n  SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'TIMESTAMP_INPUT_FORMAT' IN ACCOUNT ;\n  ```\n  \n  Copy\n  \n  ```\n  SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'DATE_INPUT_FORMAT' IN ACCOUNT ;\n  ```\n  \n  Copy\n  \n  Note\n  \n  You must set these parameters at the account level. Setting the parameters at a lower level (for example, at the session\n  level) doesn\u2019t have an effect on activating budgets or tracking usage.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)"

Queries against the usage\nviews allow you to drill down into cost data and can help generate custom reports and dashboards.\n\nIf you need an introduction to how costs are incurred in Snowflake, refer to Understanding overall cost .\n\nTo obtain a billing statement that contains information about historical usage, see Access a billing usage statement .\n\n## Viewing costs using Snowsight \u00b6\n\nSnowsight provides multiple pages that allow you to explore the historical cost of using Snowflake. For details on using these\npages to view overall costs, see:\n\n* Overview of organization-level costs\n* Overview of account-level costs\n* Drilling down into incurred costs\n\nNote\n\nKeep the following in mind when viewing costs in Snowsight:\n\n* It can take up to 72 hours for cost information to become available in Snowsight.\n* Information is shown in the UTC time zone, not your local time zone.\n\n### Overview of organization-level costs \u00b6\n\nThe Organization Overview page provides insights into how your organization is spending the capacity commitment made in the current\ncontract. For example, it shows you the remaining balance of the contract, the accumulated cost of Snowflake usage since the start of the\ncontract, and the monthly spend for the organization.\n\nIt also gives you an overview of how much each account in the organization has spent.\n\nNote\n\nThe Organization Overview page is not available in the following cases:\n\n* The organization uses On Demand accounts rather than a capacity commitment with a contract.\n* The organization signed a contract through a Snowflake reseller.\n\nTo access an overview of incurred costs at the organization level:\n\n2. Switch to a role with access to cost-related features .\n3. In the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Cost management .\n4. Select a warehouse to use to view the usage data. Snowflake recommends using an X-Small warehouse for this purpose.\n5. Select Organization Overview .\n\nThe Account Spend Summary tile has a View All option to expand the contents of the tile to include all of the accounts in the\norganization, not just the accounts that have spent the most. To display the SQL query used to populate this tile, select View All \u00bb View query (  ) .\n\n### Overview of account-level costs \u00b6\n\nThe Account Overview page provides high-level insights into the cost of using Snowflake and can be a starting off point for optimizing\nyour spend.\n\nNote\n\nAccount administrators cannot see the price of a credit or usage costs in currency unless they also have the ORGADMIN role.\n\nTo access an overview of incurred costs at the account level:\n\n2. Switch to a role with access to cost-related features .\n3. In the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Cost management .\n4. Select a warehouse to use to view the usage data. Snowflake recommends using an X-Small warehouse for this purpose.\n5. Select Account Overview .\n\nMany tiles on the Account Overview page have a View All option to expand the contents of the tile to include more items. For\nexample, for the Top warehouses by cost tile, select View All to open a dialog that displays all warehouses in your account\nsorted by cost.\n\nTo display the SQL query used to populate a tile, select View All \u00bb View query (  ) . For example, if\nyou view the query for the Top warehouses by cost tile, you see that the data comes from querying the WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema of the shared\nSNOWFLAKE database.\n\nNote\n\nCustomers who signed a contract through a Snowflake reseller cannot see the price of a credit or usage in a currency.\n\n### Drilling down into incurred costs \u00b6\n\nYou can use the Consumption page to drill down into the overall cost of using Snowflake for\nany given day, week, or month.\n\nTo use Snowsight to drill down into the overall cost:\n\n2. Switch to a role with access to cost-related features .\n3. In the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Cost management .\n4. Select a warehouse to use to view the usage data. Snowflake recommends using an X-Small warehouse for this purpose.\n5. Select Consumption .\n6. Select All Usage Types from the drop-down list.\n\nThis totals the cost of compute, storage, and data transfer resources and displays them in a bar graph using the organization\u2019s currency.\nThe total cost of these resources during the selected time period appears above the bar graph.\n\nTo isolate the cost of compute, storage, or data transfer, adjust your selection in the All Usage Types filter.\n\n#### Usage notes \u00b6\n\nKeep the following in mind when accessing the Consumption page:\n\n* It can take up to 72 hours for cost information to become available in Snowsight.\n* To access all of the features on the Consumption page, the account administrator must also have\n  the ORGADMIN role. For example, if a user has the ACCOUNTADMIN role, but does _not_ have the ORGADMIN role, they can only view costs\n  for the current account. The Account filter that would allow them to switch to a different account does not appear.\n* If the usage details fail to load with a message indicating that The result set is too large to display , you\n  must use the filters to select a shorter date range or otherwise filter the results.\n* Compute costs do not include queries executed on a warehouse by the SYSTEM user as part of a user-defined task .\n\n## Querying data for overall cost \u00b6\n\nSnowflake provides two schemas, ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE and ACCOUNT\\_USAGE , that contain data related to usage and cost. The ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema provides\ncost information for all of the accounts in the organization while the ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema provides similar information for a single\naccount. Views in these schemas provide granular, analytics-ready usage data to build custom reports or dashboards.\n\nThe following query combines data from the USAGE\\_IN\\_CURRENCY view in the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema in order to gain insight into the\noverall cost of using Snowflake.\n\nQuery: Total usage costs in dollars for the organization, broken down by account\n    ```\nSELECT account_name , \n  ROUND ( SUM ( usage_in_currency ), 2 ) as usage_in_currency \n FROM snowflake . organization_usage . usage_in_currency_daily \n WHERE usage_date > DATEADD ( month ,- 1 , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ()) \n GROUP BY 1 \n ORDER BY 2 desc ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\n**Next Topics**\n\n* Exploring compute cost\n* Exploring storage cost\n* Exploring data transfer cost\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

You can explore Snowflake system metrics using [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight) \u2014Snowflake\u2019s built-in web interface, or by writing SQL queries against [views](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-introduction) in various [schemas](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/ddl-database) . Data on your account\u2019s Snowflake usage is maintained in databases, each of which consists of one or more schemas, which are logical groupings of database objects (tables, views, etc.). Users can write custom views in SQL or use out-of-the-box Snowflake views to query metrics on usage.\nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Schemas and views\nContent:\nThe `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema can be found in the Snowflake-provided database called `SNOWFLAKE` , which contains views with usage and performance-related information for your account. This schema can be queried with views that surface execution times of queries and tasks, as well as views that surface the load on warehouses as they execute queries and tasks. It\u2019s important to note that views and tables in `ACCOUNT_USAGE` lag one to three hours behind real time.\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Query history for compute\nContent:\nThe [`QUERY_HISTORY` view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history) , which can be queried from the `ACCOUNTS_USAGE` schema, surfaces metrics that can help you right-size your virtual warehouses. There are three metrics in this schema that are particularly important.\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Warehouse metering history\nContent:\nThe [`WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/warehouse_metering_history) , which can be queried from the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema, shows you hourly credit usage for a single warehouse (or all the warehouses in your account) within the last 365 days. You can use this view to surface metrics about how your virtual warehouses are directly leading to your Snowflake spend. We\u2019ll highlight a few key metrics to keep track of here.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Metrics to watch: `CREDITS_USED` , `CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE` , `CREDITS_BILLED` , `CREDITS_ADJ...\nContent:\nIf you see a significantly higher value for `CREDITS_BILLED` than for `CREDITS_USED` , you may be performing a high volume of potentially unnecessary operations that use cloud services, and reducing that volume should lower your bill.\nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Task history\nContent:\nSnowflake [tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro) are scheduled processes that automate the execution of SQL statements, such as queries or data transformations, at specified intervals or in response to certain conditions. Tasks are commonly used to automate data pipeline workflows, [ETL/ELT](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-etl-and-elt/) processes, and other repetitive operations in Snowflake. The `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema can be queried with the [`TASK_HISTORY`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/task_history) view to surface metrics on the history of task usage in the past year. Tasks can be a big source of compute spend for your virtual warehouses, so they are important to monitor to get a full picture of where your costs are coming from. Here are some of the important task-related metrics to stay aware of.\nSection Title: ... > Metrics to watch: `STATE` , `ERROR_MESSAGE`\nContent:\n| **Name** | **Description** | **Metric Type** | **Availability** |\n| `STATE` | The status of a completed task | Event: Alert | Snowsight |\n| `ERROR_MESSAGE` | An explanation of why a task failed | Event: Alert | Snowsight |\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Clustering history\nContent:\n[Clustering](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-keys) in Snowflake helps maintain data organization based on [clustering keys](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-keys) without manual intervention, but it uses compute resources to reorganize data in [micro-partitions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-micropartitions) as data is inserted, updated, or deleted. Monitoring the [`AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING_HISTORY` view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/automatic_clustering_history) in Snowflake is essential for managing compute costs associated with automatic clustering, especially in environments with large, frequently updated tables. Here are the most important clustering metrics to monitor.\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Database usage history\nContent:\nSnowflake data is mainly stored in databases. One of the main ways you can view metrics on your database storage is with the [`DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY` view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/database_storage_usage_history) , which can be queried from the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema. This view shows you the average daily storage usage for databases.\nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Database usage history\nContent:\nIt\u2019s important to note that Snowflake gives you metrics on table size for the current point in time, not historically. This means you can estimate how much a table will cost\u2014for example, this month\u2014based on how large it is now, but you can\u2019t see how much it cost you in the past. One way around this is to keep your own history of system tables by regularly extracting and storing relevant data from Snowflake\u2019s metadata views or system tables into your own database or data storage solution. Here are some of the most important database metrics to monitor.\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Stage storage history\nContent:\nA Snowflake [stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-stage) is a location where data files are stored temporarily before they are loaded into Snowflake tables or unloaded from Snowflake to external storage. It\u2019s important to monitor stages, as they can accumulate large volumes of data, especially in environments with frequent or continuous data ingestion, and lead to increased storage costs. Monitoring stages helps prevent them from being overwhelmed with unused or old files.\nYou can monitor your stages using the [`STAGE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY` view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/stage_storage_usage_history) , which can be queried from the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema. There are two metrics in this view that are the most important.\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Query history\nContent:\nOne way to track DML operations (e.g., inserts and joins) in your databases is via the [Query History view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history) , which can be used to surface Snowflake query history by various dimensions (time range, session, user, warehouse, etc.) within the last year. The view is available in both the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` and `READER_ACCOUNT_USAGE` schemas, and contains a number of important metrics to monitor.\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Query hashes\nContent:\nWhile monitoring individual queries is vital to ensuring high performance, teams may also want to monitor patterns in their queries. To do so, it can be useful to include [query hashes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-hash) as a dimension of your inquiries into Snowflake data. The `QUERY_HASH` view can be surfaced via the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema.\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > ... > Tables\nContent:\nA Snowflake [table](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-db) is a structured object in Snowflake that stores data in a relational format\u2014this is where data is stored and organized for querying, analysis, and processing. It can be useful to monitor Snowflake tables to understand where clustering might help improve query performance.\nSnowflake uses [clustering keys](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-keys) to organize data into micro-partitions, which are smaller chunks of data stored on disk. Clustering large tables can optimize query performance by minimizing the data scanned during execution. The [`TABLES` view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/tables) , which can be queried from the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema, shows you important metrics, which we will highlight here.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > We're always looking for talented people to collaborate with\nContent:\nFeatured positions\nWe havepositions\nView all\n ... \nSection Title: Key metrics for monitoring Snowflake cost and performance > Start monitoring your metrics in minutes\nContent:\n[Continuous Testing](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/continuous-testing/) [Error Tracking](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/error-tracking/) [CloudPrem](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/cloudprem/) [Internal Developer Portal](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/internal-developer-portal/) [CI Visibility](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/ci-cd-monitoring/) [Test Optimization](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/test-optimization/) [Feature Flags](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/feature-flags/) [Code Coverage](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/code-coverage/) [Service Level Objectives](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/service-level-objectives/) [Incident Response](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/incident-response/) [Event Management](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/event-management/) [Case Management](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/case-management/) [Bits AI"
