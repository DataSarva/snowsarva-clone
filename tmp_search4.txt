Snowflake\nstrongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\nto enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\nWAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS to allocate usage\nto relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\nSnowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Query tags for granular workload attribution:** [Query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) can be set via session parameters (e.g., ALTER SESSION SET QUERY_TAG =\n'your_tag';) or directly within SQL clients or ETL tools. This\nassociates individual queries with specific departments, projects, or\napplications, even when using shared warehouses. This is extremely\nvaluable for shared warehouses where multiple teams or applications\nuse the same compute resource, allowing for granular showback. It is\nalso easy to programmatically make changes to query tags within\nscripts or processes to allocate costs appropriately. Query tags can\nbe found in the QUERY_HISTORY view of the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE\nschema.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Tagging models**\nIn the initial setup of a business unit or use case, it is important to\nconsider the [model for tagging](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) costs within the platform via shared or dedicated resources. These fall\ninto three large buckets:\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate warehouses with a\ndepartment. You can use object tags to attribute the costs incurred by\nthose warehouses to that department entirely. **Resources shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of\nthis is a warehouse shared by users from different departments. In\nthis case, you use object tags to associate each user with a\ndepartment. The costs of queries are attributed to the users. Using\nthe object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by\ndepartment. **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\nqueries on behalf of its users.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits.

Disable automatic clustering on tables that are barely touched\nContent:\nWhile automatic clustering can improve query performance, it runs on serverless compute. This means it racks up Snowflake credits whether anyone’s actually using the table or not.\nIf the table is only getting hit a few times a week, that background compute activity is just silently chipping away at your budget. This is where smart Snowflake cost optimization begins.\nLook for tables with automatic clustering enabled that barely get queried, say, fewer than 100 times per week. Ask yourself if these tables are part of a disaster recovery setup or being shared with another account. If not, it’s probably safe to hit pause.\nTo suspend automatic clustering, run:\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake cost optimization: 8 proven strategies for reducing costs > What is a KPI in Snowflake?\nContent:\nFor Snowflake cost optimization, KPIs are your best friend.\nSnowflake offers a bunch of performance metrics that, when tracked together, paint a full picture.
