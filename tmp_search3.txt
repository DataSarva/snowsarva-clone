This chargeback or showback model is useful for accounting purposes and pinpoints\nareas of the organization that could benefit from controls and optimizations that can reduce costs.\nTo attribute costs to different groups like departments or projects, use the following recommended approach:\nUse [object tags](object-tagging/introduction) to associate resources and users with departments or projects.\nUse [query tags](../sql-reference/parameters.html) to associate individual queries with departments or projects when the queries are\nmade by the same application on behalf of users belonging to multiple departments.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Setting up object tags for cost attribution [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nThe examples in these sections use the custom role `tag_admin` , which is assumed to have been granted the privileges to\ncreate and manage tags.

It is\nfoundational to the FinOps framework, as you cannot control, optimize,\nor attribute business value to what you cannot see. To effectively\nmanage and optimize cloud costs in Snowflake, it's crucial to align\norganizationally to an accountability structure of spend, gain deep and\ngranular insight into all aspects of your cloud spending, and\ntransparently display it to the appropriate stakeholders to take action.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nThis\nsignificantly reduces the manual effort required for tagging and\nensures that new objects created within a tagged schema or propagated\nworkflow automatically inherit the correct cost attribution. Snowflake\nstrongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\nto enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\nWAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS to allocate usage\nto relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\nSnowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Query tags for granular workload attribution:** [Query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) can be set via session parameters (e.g., ALTER SESSION SET QUERY_TAG =\n'your_tag';) or directly within SQL clients or ETL tools. This\nassociates individual queries with specific departments, projects, or\napplications, even when using shared warehouses. This is extremely\nvaluable for shared warehouses where multiple teams or applications\nuse the same compute resource, allowing for granular showback. It is\nalso easy to programmatically make changes to query tags within\nscripts or processes to allocate costs appropriately. Query tags can\nbe found in the QUERY_HISTORY view of the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE\nschema.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Tagging models**\nIn the initial setup of a business unit or use case, it is important to\nconsider the [model for tagging](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) costs within the platform via shared or dedicated resources. These fall\ninto three large buckets:\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate warehouses with a\ndepartment. You can use object tags to attribute the costs incurred by\nthose warehouses to that department entirely. **Resources shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of\nthis is a warehouse shared by users from different departments. In\nthis case, you use object tags to associate each user with a\ndepartment. The costs of queries are attributed to the users. Using\nthe object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by\ndepartment. **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\nqueries on behalf of its users.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits.

While Snowflake’s per-second billing offers flexibility, it also means a single efficient query can eat through hundreds of dollars – which is why manual warehouse management can’t keep pace with enterprise-sized workloads.\nThe bright side: modern Snowflake FinOps fixes this with automated systems that allow you to optimize spend and performance in real time.\nHow do you get to that point? Read on. We’ll share all of our FinOps best practices,e automation strategies, and real-world tactics that have helped enterprises cut monthly Snowflake costs by 30% or more.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake FinOps: Complete Guide to Automated Cost Optimization > What is FinOps for Snowflake?\nContent:\n**Credit-based consumption:** At $2-4 per credit (depending on your region and edition) with cost scaling linearly from X-Small (1 credit/hour) to 6X-Large (512 credits/hour).\n**Query-level optimization:** Using QUERY_HISTORY and WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY views to identify expensive queries before they ruin your budget.\n**Dynamic warehouse scaling:** Beyond basic auto-suspend, implementing intelligent scaling based on queue depth and query complexity\n**Storage and** [**data transfer**](https://yukidata.com/blog/snowflake-data-transfer-costs-complete-guide/) **:** Long-term storage and cross-regional replication can add significant costs if not managed with lifestyle policies and governance.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake FinOps: Complete Guide to Automated Cost Optimization > ... > The Compliance Complexity\nContent:\nEnterprise FinOps needs control, not just cost reduction.
