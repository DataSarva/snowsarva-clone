Snowflake's elastic, credit-based consumption model charges\nseparately for compute (Virtual Warehouses, Compute Pools, etc),\nstorage, data transfer, and various serverless features (e.g., Snowpipe,\nAutomatic Clustering, Search Optimization, Replication/Failover, AI\nServices). Understanding the interplay of these billing types ensures\nyou can attribute costs associated with each category’s unique usage\nparameters. High-level categories are below.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nThis\nsignificantly reduces the manual effort required for tagging and\nensures that new objects created within a tagged schema or propagated\nworkflow automatically inherit the correct cost attribution. Snowflake\nstrongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\nto enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\nWAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS to allocate usage\nto relevant business groups.

This\nassociates individual queries with specific departments, projects, or\napplications, even when using shared warehouses. This is extremely\nvaluable for shared warehouses where multiple teams or applications\nuse the same compute resource, allowing for granular showback. It is\nalso easy to programmatically make changes to query tags within\nscripts or processes to allocate costs appropriately. Query tags can\nbe found in the QUERY_HISTORY view of the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE\nschema.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits.

If an\norganization is caught between models, a common approach is to start in\na shared resource environment and graduate to dedicated resources as the\nworkload increases.\n**Tag enforcement**\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Snowsight's built-in cost management capabilities:** Snowsight\nprovides pre-built visuals for usage and credit monitoring directly\nwithin the [Snowflake Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) . It allows filtering by tags (e.g., view cost by department tag),\ncredit consumption by object types, and cost insights to optimize the\nplatform. **Creating custom dashboards or Streamlit apps for different stakeholder groups:** Snowsight facilitates the creation of custom\ndashboards using ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE views. Custom\ncharts in the Dashboards feature and Streamlit apps can both be easily\nshared. Combined with cost allocation and tagging, this allows for\ntailored views for finance managers (aggregated spend), engineering\nmanagers (warehouse utilization), or data analysts (query\nperformance).\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Forecast consumption based on business needs\nContent:\n**Identify demand drivers and unit economics:** To understand what\ndrives Snowflake spend, correlate historical credit, storage, and data\ntransfer usage with key business metrics like cost per customer or per\ntransaction. Use Snowflake's [ACCOUNT_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) schema, including the WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and QUERY_HISTORY\nviews, as the primary data sources for this analysis.\n**Granular cost attribution:** Accurately tie costs back to business\nteams or workloads by implementing a mandatory tagging strategy for\nall warehouses and queries.

This makes many teams jump in, only to realize later that their [Snowflake spend](https://ternary.app/blog/manage-your-snowflake-costs/) is climbing faster than expected.\nThis is because managing Snowflake costs often becomes a sticking point despite the platform being impressive from a tech POV. That’s where Snowflake cost optimization comes in.\nIn this guide, we’ll explore how Snowflake pricing works and how you can stay in control without giving up performance or flexibility.\nSection Title: ... > Snowflake cost components\nContent:\nSnowflake’s architecture has 3 layers:\nStorage\nCompute (which Snowflake calls virtual warehouses)\nCloud services\nThese layers are billed separately, and Snowflake pricing is usage-based, meaning you get charged for what you actually use.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 2. Drop materialized views that don’t pull their weight\nContent:\nMaterialized views store precomputed results so queries can run faster.\nBut at the same time, they come with both storage and serverless compute costs to keep everything up to date. So if a materialized view is only being queried, say, ten times a week? You’re paying for upkeep that’s barely getting used.\nIt’s a solid move to suspend or remove any materialized views that aren’t actively helping performance. This falls right into the category of low-effort, high-impact snowflake cost optimization. But again, double-check if the view exists for data sharing or backup purposes before you go on a deletion spree.\nTo drop a materialized view, run:\nSection Title: ... > 2.

The FOCUS specification is an open schema maintained by the Foundation where providers and vendors can map their cost and usage data to a consistent model. This makes it easier for enterprises to aggregate, analyze, and act on cost data across multi-cloud and SaaS ecosystems.\nSection Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake — Insights from a Streamlit App > Why FinOps Matters\nContent:\nIn the case of Snowflake, it provides native transparency through `ACCOUNT_USAGE` and `ORGANIZATION_USAGE` views, giving teams near real-time insights into where credits are being consumed—whether in warehouses, queries, or storage. Its credit-based billing model is also directly recognized in the FOCUS specification, ensuring alignment with the industry’s standard for cloud cost and usage data. You can see the details of the FOCUS v1.2 spec [here](https://focus.finops.org/focus-specification/v1-2/) .\n*Note: At the time of writing, FOCUS v2.1 is the latest version. Snowflake mappings are still primarily aligned with v1.2, which means some newer dimensions (e.g., richer invoice identifiers, commitments) require external enrichment pipelines.*\n ... \nSection Title: ... > What is Possible in the Snowflake Portal\nContent:\nThe Snowflake web portal provides native visibility into cost and usage, enabling FinOps practices directly within the platform. From the Billing & Usage section, customers can download detailed usage statements that include credits consumed, billing currency, and invoiced amounts. These statements serve as the source of truth for financial reconciliation and can be mapped into the FOCUS specification for standardized reporting.\nIn addition, the portal exposes Snowsight dashboards for monitoring warehouse utilization, query activity, and service-level costs. Finance and engineering teams can leverage these dashboards to track trends, attribute spend, and spot anomalies without external tools. While deeper FinOps workflows may require exporting data to FOCUS-compliant pipelines, the portal ensures that organizations always have a clear, auditable view of Snowflake consumption and spend.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Why Build a Custom Cost Analytics App?\nContent:\nSnowflake’s native portal and Snowsight dashboards provide useful insights into usage, spend, and warehouse performance — great for quick checks and financial reconciliation. But when teams need interactive, FinOps-oriented analysis, a custom Streamlit app inside Snowflake delivers more. By combining live telemetry ( `ACCOUNT_USAGE` ) with pre-aggregated snapshots, applying cost-aware caching, and drilling into query-level cost drivers, the app goes beyond static reporting. It enforces permission checks, adds filters by service or warehouse, and surfaces the underlying SQL so Finance and Engineering share the same transparent view. In short, it transforms Snowflake telemetry into a collaborative cockpit for FinOps, aligning data with FOCUS dimensions and enabling actionable insights, accountability, and optimization at scale.\n ... \nSection Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake — Insights from a Streamlit App > 📚 Further Reading\nContent:\n[Deep Dive: Snowflake’s Query Cost Attribution — Greybeam Blog](https://blog.greybeam.ai/snowflake-cost-per-query)\n[Implement Cost Monitoring Dashboards using Snowsight — Medium](/snowflake/implement-cost-monitoring-alerting-using-snowsight-b54ee0d269dc)\n[Snowflake Database — Account Usage & Information Schema — Medium](/@trustngs/snowflake-snowpro-core-preparation-part-9-account-usage-information-schema-71ac0fe4d8c0)\n[Optimize Snowflake Spend with the New Cost Management Interface — Snowflake Blog](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/optimize-spend-new-cost-management-interface/)\n[Mastering Snowflake Warehouse Utilization — Medium](/snowflake/mastering-snowflake-warehouse-utilization-a-deep-dive-into-the-warehouse-utilization-view-855fa72fdf11)\n[A Deep Dive into Snowflake Storage Costs — Select.dev](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-storage)\n[Key Snowflake Metrics — Datadog"]},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/views","title":"VIEWS view | Snowflake Documentation","excerpts":["[DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.snowflake.com)\n/\n[Get started](/en/user-guide-getting-started)\n[Guides](/en/guides)\n[Developer](/en/developer)\n[Reference](/en/reference)\n[Release notes](/en/release-notes/overview)\n[Tutorials](/en/tutorials)\n[Status](https://status.snowflake.com)\n[Reference](/en/reference) [General reference](/en/sql-reference) [SNOWFLAKE database](/en/sql-reference/snowflake-db) [Account Usage](/en/sql-reference/account-usage) VIEWS\nSchema:\n[ACCOUNT_USAGE](../account-usage.html)\nSection Title: VIEWS view [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nThis Account Usage view displays a row for each view in the account, not including the views in the ACCOUNT_USAGE, READER_ACCOUNT_USAGE, and INFORMATION_SCHEMA schemas.\nSee also:\n[TABLES view](tables)\nSection Title: VIEWS view [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Columns [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n| Column Name | Data Type | Description |\n| TABLE_ID | NUMBER | Internal/system-generated identifier for the view. |\n| TABLE_NAME | VARCHAR | Name of the view. |\n| TABLE_SCHEMA_ID | NUMBER | Internal/system-generated identifier for the schema that the view belongs to. |\n| TABLE_SCHEMA | VARCHAR | Schema that the view belongs to. |\n| TABLE_CATALOG_ID | NUMBER | Internal/system-generated identifier for the database that the view belongs to. |\n| TABLE_CATALOG | VARCHAR | Database that the view belongs to. |\n| TABLE_OWNER | VARCHAR | Name of the role that owns the view. |\n| VIEW_DEFINITION | VARCHAR | Text of the query expression for the view. |\n| CHECK_OPTION | VARCHAR | Not applicable for Snowflake. |\n| IS_UPDATABLE | VARCHAR | Not applicable for Snowflake. |\n| INSERTABLE_INTO | VARCHAR | Not applicable for Snowflake. |\n| IS_SECURE | VARCHAR | Specifies whether the view is secure. |\n ... \nSection Title: VIEWS view [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Columns [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nFor dropped users, you can join the `<id>` with the USER_ID column in the USERS view of the ACCOUNT_USAGE or ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema. |\n|DELETED |TIMESTAMP_LTZ |Date and time when the view was deleted. |\n|COMMENT |VARCHAR |Comment for the view. |\n|INSTANCE_ID |NUMBER |Internal/system-generated identifier for the instance which the object belongs to. |\n|OWNER_ROLE_TYPE |VARCHAR |The type of role that owns the object, for example `ROLE` . .
