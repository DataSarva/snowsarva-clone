        "Section Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6\nContent:\nCredit usage limits can be set for a specified interval or date range. When a limit is reached and/or reaches a specified threshold,\nthe resource monitor can trigger various actions, such as sending alert notifications and/or suspending user-managed warehouses.\nOnly users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create a resource monitor, but an account administrator can grant privileges to other roles\nto allow other users to view and modify resource monitors.\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Credit quota \u00b6\nContent:\nCredit quota specifies the number of Snowflake credits allocated to the monitor for the specified frequency interval. Any number can be specified.\nIn addition, Snowflake tracks the *used credits/quota* within the specified frequency interval by all warehouses assigned to the monitor.\nAt the specified interval, this number resets to `0` .\nCredit quota accounts for credits consumed by both user-managed virtual warehouses and virtual warehouses used by cloud services.\nFor example, your resource monitor limit is set at 1000 credits. If your warehouse consumes 700 credits, and cloud services consume 300\ncredits within a specified interval or date range, an alert will be triggered.\nNote\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Credit quota \u00b6\nContent:\nResource monitor limits do not take into account the daily 10% adjustment for cloud services. Snowflake uses all credit consumption by\nthe cloud services layer to calculate whether a limit has been reached, even if that consumption is never billed. For more information\nabout how cloud services credits and adjustments are calculated, see Understanding billing for cloud services usage .\nFor instructions on how to view your cloud services credit usage, see Exploring compute cost .\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor properties \u00b6 > Actions \u00b6\nContent:\nAlso referred to as *triggers* , each action specifies a threshold, as a percentage of the credit quota for the resource monitor, and the\naction to perform when the threshold is reached within the specified interval. Note that actions support thresholds greater than `100` .\nResource monitors support the following actions:\nNotify & Suspend :\nSend a notification and suspend all assigned warehouses after all statements being executed by the warehouse(s) have completed.\nNotify & Suspend Immediately :\nSend a notification and suspend all assigned warehouses immediately, which cancels any statements being executed by the warehouses\nat the time.\nNotify :\nPerform no action on warehouses, but send a notification.\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Assignment of resource monitors \u00b6\nContent:\nThe credit quota for the entire account is 5000 for the interval (month, week, etc.), as controlled by Resource Monitor 1; if this quota\nis reached within the interval, the actions defined for the resource monitor ( **Suspend** , **Suspend Immediate** , etc.) are enforced for\nall five warehouses.\nWarehouse 3 can consume a maximum of 1000 credits within the interval.\nWarehouse 4 and 5 can consume a maximum combined total of 2500 credits within the interval.\nNote that the actual credits consumed by Warehouses 3, 4, and 5 may be less than their quotas if the quota for the account is reached first.\nImportant\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Warehouse suspension and resumption \u00b6\nContent:\nIf you wish to strictly enforce your quotas, we recommend the following:\nUtilize buffers in the quota thresholds for actions (e.g. set a threshold to 90% instead of 100%).This will help ensure that your credit usage doesn\u2019t exceed the quota.\nTo more strictly control credit usage for individual warehouses, assign only a single warehouse to each resource monitor.When multiple warehouses are assigned to the same resource monitor, they share the same quota thresholds, which may result in credit\nusage for one warehouse impacting the other assigned warehouses.\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Resource monitor notifications \u00b6\nContent:\nWhen a resource monitor reaches the threshold for an action , it generates a notification\nsimilar to the following notification:\n```\nResource Monitor MY_ACCOUNT_MONITOR has reached 50% of its MONTHLY \n quota of 500 credits which has triggered a <action> action.\n```\nThe `<action>` is one of the following actions:\nNOTIFY\nSUSPEND\nSUSPEND_IMMEDIATE\nNotification behavior depends on the type of resource monitor and whether or not notifications\nare enabled for an individual user. Notifications are sent as follows:\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > ... > Creating a resource monitor with a default schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nYou can create a resource monitor that uses the default schedule using the web interface or SQL.\nNote\nOnly users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create resource monitors.\nSnowsight :\n2. In the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Cost management .\n3. Select Resource Monitors , then select + Resource Monitor .\n4. For Name , enter a name for the resource monitor.\n5.

Choose Account to create an account monitor or\nchoose Warehouse to select the warehouses to monitor.\n7. For Actions , choose which notifications to enable by entering a threshold next to the option. You must select at\nleast one option.\nSelect Add to create additional notifications. You can specify up to five notify actions.\nSQL :\nIn SQL, this task is performed in two steps:\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > ... > Creating a resource monitor with a default schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nTo create a monitor that starts monitoring immediately, resets at the beginning of each month, and suspends the assigned warehouse\nwhen the used credits reach 100% of the credit quota:CopyThe SUSPEND action waits for currently executing queries to finish before suspending the warehouse. A query might start before the\nthreshold is reached and complete after the SUSPEND action is triggered. In this case, the warehouse continues to consume credits\neven after the quota is reached. To create a similar monitor that suspends at 90% and suspends immediately at 100% after the quota has been reached:CopyIn this example, a notification is sent and the assigned warehouses are suspended when 90% of the credit quota is reached. Currently executing queries complete, but the resource monitor prevents the warehouses from executing any new queries.\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > ... > Creating a resource monitor with a default schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nIf the assigned warehouses reach 100% of the credit quota, a notification is sent and the warehouses are suspended immediately,\ncanceling all currently executing queries. This prevents all warehouses in the account from consuming credits. To create a monitor that is similar to the first example, but lets the assigned warehouse exceed the quota by 10% and also includes two\nnotification actions to alert account administrators as the used credits reach the halfway and three-quarters points for the quota:CopyIn this example:\nWhen 50% and 75% usage is reached, an alert notification is sent to all account administrators who have enabled notifications, but no\nother actions are performed. When 100% usage is reached, the assigned warehouse is suspended. If the warehouse is still running when 110% usage is reached, it is suspended immediately.\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > ... > Creating a resource monitor with a custom schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nYou can create a resource monitor that uses a schedule other than the default using the web interface or SQL.\nNote\nOnly users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create resource monitors.\nComplete the following steps to create a resource monitor with a custom schedule:\nSnowsight :\n2. In the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Cost management .\n3. Select Resource Monitors , then select + Resource Monitor .\n4. For Name , enter a name for the resource monitor.\n5. For Credit Quota , enter the number of credits for each specified interval.\n6. Select the Monitor Type . Choose Account to create an account monitor or\nchoose Warehouse to select the warehouses to monitor.\n7. Select Schedule \u00bb Customize to set a custom schedule for the specified interval. You can skip this step to use the default schedule .\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > ... > Creating a resource monitor with a custom schedule \u00b6\nContent:\nYou can set a custom start and end date using Custom Start Date and Custom End Date , or specify a date range\nby using the Range tab.\nNote\nIf you choose to end monitoring at a specified date and time, all assigned warehouses are suspended on that date and time even\nif the credit quota has not been reached. A notification is sent when this occurs that states the resource monitor has reached\na percentage of its quota and has triggered a suspend immediate action. The percentage of the quota reflects the number\nof used credits in the current interval up to the end date and might not be a threshold you specified.\nYou can also customize the specified interval for monitoring. Select Resets and you can select from the following periodic\nintervals at which to reset the credit quota:\n```\n+ Monthly\n+ Daily\n+ Weekly\n+ Yearly\n+ Never\n```\n ... \nSection Title: Working with resource monitors \u00b6 > Modifying a resource monitor \u00b6\nContent:\nTo modify the credit quota, schedule, or actions for a resource monitor, a user must use a role with the MODIFY\nprivilege on the resource monitor.\nTo modify the monitor type for a resource monitor from warehouse to account or vice versa, a user must use the\nACCOUNTADMIN role.\nTo modify the list of warehouses for a warehouse-level resource monitor, a user must use the ACCOUNTADMIN role.\nSnowsight :\n2.

In addition, this action sends a notification to all\nusers who have enabled notifications for themselves.`SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE` : Suspend all assigned warehouses immediately and cancel any currently running queries or statements using\nthe warehouses.\nSection Title: CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR \u00b6 > Optional parameters \u00b6\nContent:\nIn addition, this action sends a notification to all users who have enabled notifications for themselves.`NOTIFY` : Send a notification (to all account administrators with notifications enabled), but do not take any other action.\n ... \nSection Title: CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR \u00b6 > Usage notes \u00b6\nContent:\nTriggers are optional; however, at least one trigger must be added to a resource monitor before it can perform any actions. Each resource monitor supports up to a maximum of 5 `NOTIFY` action triggers. After a resource monitor is created, it must be assigned to a warehouse or account before it can perform any monitoring actions:\nTo assign a warehouse to a resource monitor, use ALTER WAREHOUSE (or CREATE WAREHOUSE if you are creating the warehouse). To assign a resource monitor at the account level, use ALTER ACCOUNT . The NOTIFY_USERS parameter must be null. To view all resource monitors created in your account and their assignment, use the SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS command. The command\noutput displays `NULL` in the `level` column for resource monitors that are not assigned to the account or any warehouses\nand, therefore, are not monitoring any credit usage.\nSection Title: CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR \u00b6 > Usage notes \u00b6\nContent:\nIf `frequency` and `start_timestamp` parameters are set on a resource monitor, the day for the credit usage reset is\ncalculated based on those parameters. The time the credit usage resets to `0` is 12:00 AM UTC regardless of the time specified in `start_timestamp` . If you specify an `end_timestamp` , monitoring ends at that specified date and time and all assigned warehouses are suspended\nat that date and time even if the credit quota has not been reached.When this occurs, a notification is sent that states the resource monitor has reached a percentage of its quota and has triggered a\nsuspend immediate action. The percentage of the quota reflects the number of credits used in the current interval up to the end date\nand might not be a threshold you specified. If there are non-administrator users in the notification list, the following notes apply:\nIf any user in the notification list does not have a verified email ,\nthe SQL statement fails.\nSection Title: CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR \u00b6 > Usage notes \u00b6\nContent:\nIf any user in the notification list changes their email address and does not verify the new email address, the\nnotification silently fails. The notification list is limited to a maximum number of 5 non-administrator users. Account administrators can view the notification list of non-administrator users in the output of SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS in the `notify_user` column. Regarding metadata:AttentionCustomers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake . The OR REPLACE and IF NOT EXISTS clauses are mutually exclusive. They can\u2019t both be used in the same statement. CREATE OR REPLACE ** statements are atomic. That is, when an object is replaced, the old object is deleted and the new object is created in a single transaction.\nSection Title: CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR \u00b6 > Usage notes \u00b6\nContent:\nImportant\nTo receive notifications generated by resource monitors, account administrators and non-administrator users in the notification\nlist must explicitly enable notifications in their preferences. In addition, to receive email notifications, users must have a\nverified email in their preferences. Preferences can only\nbe set in the Snowflake web interface.

In this post we cover everything you need to know about how to configure and best utilize resource monitors in your account. To start things off, let's cover why you should use resource monitors in the first place.\nSection Title: Controlling Costs with Snowflake Resource Monitors > What are Snowflake resource monitors for?\nContent:\nSnowflake's usage-based pricing model and ease of scaling allow customers to pay for just the resources they need while quickly scaling to meet demand. The downside is that Snowflake costs can rise unexpectedly when left unchecked or without proper controls in place. Resource monitors help users monitor and control costs by sending notifications at defined spend thresholds. Resource monitors can also be configured to help avoid early contract renewal by mitigating unexpected credit usage.\nSection Title: Controlling Costs with Snowflake Resource Monitors > What do Snowflake resource monitors do?\nContent:\nResource monitors allow users to specify a Snowflake credit limit for a given resource and timeframe. For example, a warehouse or grouping of warehouses can be assigned a daily credit limit of 50 credits per day. When the specified percentage of that limit is reached in the given timeframe, resource monitors can trigger different actions. The three possible actions are:\nNotify the user via email\nSuspend the warehouse(s) after all queries are finished running\nImmediately suspend the warehouse(s) and abort any running queries\nOutside of warehouses, resource monitors can be configured for an entire account.\nThe screenshot below shows an example of an email notification sent by a resource monitor.\n ... \nSection Title: Controlling Costs with Snowflake Resource Monitors > ... > Creating a resource monitor in the UI\nContent:\nTo create a new resource monitor in the Snowflake UI, navigate to the Admin > Resource Monitors section. After clicking the \"+ Resource Monitor\" button in the top right, you'll be prompted to fill out the following details:\n**Name** : Set this to anything you like, but note that spaces are not allowed\n**Credit Quota** : The desired credit allowance for the monitor\n**Monitor Type** : Either \"Account\" or \"Warehouse\". If \"Account\", the credit quoata applies to the entire account. If \"Warehouse\", the quota only applies to the warehouses you specify.\n**Warehouse(s)** : If you chose \"Warehouse\" as your monitor type, then you will be prompted to select 1 or more warehouses to associate with the monitor.\nSection Title: Controlling Costs with Snowflake Resource Monitors > ... > Creating a resource monitor in the UI\nContent:\n**Schedule** : Here, the start time and (optional) end time for when the resource monitor operates can be configured. The frequency at which the resource monitor resets its credit count can also be set. Supported options for this include: daily, monthly, yearly and never.\n**Actions** : At least one action must be configured to create the monitor.\nSection Title: Controlling Costs with Snowflake Resource Monitors > ... > Creating a resource monitor with SQL\nContent:\nAn example command to create a resource monitor with SQL is shown below:\n```\n1 create or replace resource monitor compute_warehouse_monitor with credit_quota=5 frequency=daily start_timestamp=immediately triggers on 75 percent do notify on 100 percent do suspend on 110 percent do suspend_immediate ;\n```\nTo assign the monitor to the `COMPUTE` warehouse, run the following:\n`alter warehouse compute set resource_monitor = compute_warehouse_monitor`\nThe full syntax for this command can be found in the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-resource-monitor) .\nSection Title: ... > What resource monitors should you consider creating?\nContent:\nConsider creating an account-level resource monitor based on your Snowflake contract amount. This can help ensure you don't finish your contract budget earlier than expected.\nFor example, if the remaining Snowflake contract balance is $240,000 over the next 6 months, then you could set a monthly account resource monitor with a credit quota of 16,000 credits (assuming a credit price of $2.5/credit). You could choose to get notified by email if the account's credit usage exceeds 100% of that quota.\nAnother recommendation is to create a resource monitor to alert you of any credit usage spikes. To accomplish this, you could create a resource monitor to send an alert whenever daily spend exceeds 1.5x the average daily amount. We recommend adjusting this threshold multiple as needed to avoid being alerted too frequently.\nSection Title: Controlling Costs with Snowflake Resource Monitors > How do you view resource monitors?\nContent:\nResource monitors can be viewed in the Snowflake UI under Admin -> Resource Monitors:\nAlternatively, you can run `show resource monitors` as a SQL statement:\nSection Title: Controlling Costs with Snowflake Resource Monitors > Who can create or access resource monitors?\nContent:\nResource monitors can only be created by account administrators. Once a resource monitor is created, [roles](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-roles) can be granted [access to view or modify a monitor](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-privileges) . Access has to be granted to each resource monitor individually.\nAny user in Snowflake can receive email notifications from resource monitors. This is accomplished using SQL by setting the `NOTIFY USERS` parameter on the resource monitor. See the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-resource-monitor) for more details.\nSection Title: ... > What are the downsides of Snowflake resource monitors?\nContent:\nWhile resource monitors are a great starting point for controlling Snowflake credit usage and avoiding unexpected charges, there are a few downsides as of today.\nFirst, you can only set resource monitors at the account or warehouse level. Serverless features such as automatic clustering or materialized views can also incur sudden charges but are not supported by resource monitors.\nResource monitors only support notifications via email. Most teams prefer to receive notifications directly in Slack or Teams along with the rest of their alerts and team communication.\nAdditionally, as shown in the screenshot earlier, the email notifications contain little information about what caused the credit allowance to be exceeded. Users must then dig through their account usage data to determine what caused the spike.\n ... \nSection Title: Controlling Costs with Snowflake Resource Monitors > Troubleshooting no email from resource monitor\nContent:\nIf you are not receiving an email from a resource monitor, it may be because notifications haven't been enabled for the Snowflake admin. See [this page](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) for instructions on how to accomplish that.\nIan Whitestone \u00b7 Co-founder & CEO of SELECT\nIan is the Co-founder & CEO of SELECT, a SaaS Snowflake cost management and optimization platform.

        "Section Title: ... > What is a resource monitor in Snowflake?\nContent:\nSnowflake warehouse resource monitors are built-in tools that help users avoid unexpected credit consumption when running warehouses. After all, the more credits you consume, the more you spend (read our complete guide to [how Snowflake pricing works](https://keebo.ai/2024/04/11/how-does-snowflake-pricing-work/) here).\nWhen you create a resource monitor in Snowflake, you\u2019re essentially setting thresholds to control credit consumption for specific virtual warehouses. Once these thresholds are reached, the monitor can trigger predefined actions such as sending alerts, suspending warehouses, or preventing new queries from running to stop costs from escalating further.\nUsers can set up resource monitors to suspend a warehouse or send notifications when it consumes a certain number of credits. Here are the components that create a resource monitor in Snowflake.\nSection Title: ... > Credit quota\nContent:\nCredit quota indicates the number of Snowflake credits allocated to the Snowflake warehouse resource monitor for the specified frequency interval (monthly by default, but this can be customized). The quota includes the total of all resources consumed\u2014warehouse, serverless, and cloud services. Credit quotas do not include the [daily 10% adjustment for cloud services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute) .\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Schedule\nContent:\nThe schedule determines the interval after which used credits will reset to zero. By default, Snowflake sets resource monitor schedules to reset at the beginning of each calendar month, as this aligns with the standard [Snowflake billing cycles](https://keebo.ai/2024/07/01/how-often-are-snowflake-bills-generated/) .\nYou can customize your resource monitor schedule by frequency (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly), never (i.e. used credits never reset), and start (i.e. immediately or later) and end times.\nSection Title: ... > Actions\nContent:\nYou can set triggers for specific actions at certain percentages of the resource monitor\u2019s credit quota. These actions include notification, suspend, or both. For example, if you consume 70% of your credit quota, you can send a notification to your account manager so they can make necessary adjustments. When you reach 100%, you can set the warehouse to automatically suspend.\nNotifications will look like the following:\n```\nResource Monitor KEEBO_ACCOUNT_MONITOR has reached 50% of its MONTHLY quota of 500 credits which has triggered a NOTIFY action.    \n  \nResource Monitor KEEBO_WAREHOUSE_1_MONITOR has reached 90% of its MONTHLY quota of 500 credits which has triggered a SUSPEND action.\n```\nEveryone other than users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role will receive these notifications via email.\nOnce a resource monitor suspends a warehouse, it cannot be resumed until one of the following conditions is met:\nSection Title: ... > Actions\nContent:\nThe next interval starts\nAdmin increases the monitor\u2019s credit quota\nAdmin increases the credit threshold for suspend actions\nAdmin removes warehouses from the monitor\nAdmin drops the monitor\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Creating a resource monitor in Snowslight\nContent:\nSign into Snowsight\nGo to Admin >> Cost Management\nSelect Resource Monitors, then + Resource Monitor\nEnter a Name for the resource monitor\nEnter the Credit Quota for the specified interval\nSelect Monitor Type. Choose either Account or Warehouse.\nEnter a threshold next to each Action option. Select Add to create additional notifications. You can add up to five notify actions.\nSelect Schedule >> Customize to set a custom interval within which the credit quota will reset. Keep in mind that you cannot change a customized schedule for a resource monitor back to the default. Instead, you must drop the monitor and recreate it.\nSection Title: ... > Creating a resource monitor in the Snowflake classic console\nContent:\nSelect Account >> Resource Monitors >> Create Resource Monitor\nEnter a resource monitor Name\nEnter your Credit Quota\nSelect the Monitor Level (i.e. Account or Warehouse)\nSelect the Actions and Notifications you want to enable indicating a threshold next to each option.\nSelect +Add to add additional actions (up to five notify actions total).\nSelect Schedule >> Customize to set a custom interval within which the credit quota will reset. Keep in mind that you cannot change a customized schedule for a resource monitor back to the default. Instead, you must drop the monitor and recreate it.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Modifying a resource monitor in Snowflake upon creation\nContent:\nOnce you create a resource monitor in Snowflake, you can go in and make the following changes:\nIncrease or decrease the credit quota\nModify the customized schedule (reverting to the default schedule requires dropping the monitor and launching a new one)\nAdd or remove actions\nAdjust thresholds for existing actions\nConvert account monitor to warehouse monitor\nConvert warehouse monitor to account monitor\nAdd or remove warehouses from warehouse monitor\nKeep in mind that making these changes won\u2019t impact the credits used to date for that monitor. They only affect credits used after the changes are saved.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Modifying a resource monitor in SQL\nContent:\nExecute an ALTER RESOURCE MONITOR statement. For example, change the credit quota with the following command:\n```\nALTER RESOURCE MONITOR control1 SET CREDIT_QUOTA=4000;\n```\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Rigid structure\nContent:\nSnowflake cost monitoring,  as we\u2019ve extensively laid out above, are based on rigid parameters. At best, you set your credit quotas and schedules based on previous performance. At worst, you\u2019re guessing at how many credits you\u2019ll actually need.\nIn either case, data cloud workloads are dynamic, and often rely on factors outside anyone\u2019s control. A growing user base, inefficient query writing, unexpected spikes in requests\u2014these always come up unexpectedly, and they don\u2019t care what your credit quota is.\nThe only solution is to go in and manually adjust quotas based on these changes. But that\u2019s a lot of work, and whatever you\u2019re saving in credits you\u2019re probably spending in the hours spent in manual adjustments.\nSection Title: ... > Obscured performance metrics\nContent:\nSnowflake cost monitoring is based solely on credit usage. A number of factors go into determining credit usage: query volume, execution time, and warehouse size being the most relevant.\nFor example, if you set a NOTIFY command when your credit quota reaches 50%, all you really know is you\u2019ve used half your credits. You don\u2019t have insight into *why* those credits were consumed so quickly and, most importantly, how to fix it. Did you get an influx of users that increased your query volume for a 24-hour period? Did a handful of inexperienced data analysts write inefficient queries that consumed too much compute? Snowflake resource monitors won\u2019t answer those questions\u2014which means you can\u2019t act on the information you receive.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Author\nContent:\n[Collin David](https://keebo.ai/2024/07/29/controlling-costs-with-resource-monitors-in-snowflake-what-they-can-cant-do/ \"Collin David\")[View all posts](https://keebo.ai/2024/07/29/controlling-costs-with-resource-monitors-in-snowflake-what-they-can-cant-do/ \"View all posts\")"

Ein virtuelles Warehouse verbraucht w\u00e4hrend seiner Ausf\u00fchrung Snowflake-Credits. Sie k\u00f6nnen einen Ressourcenmonitor zur \u00dcberwachung der Credit-Nutzung durch virtuelle Warehouses und durch die zur Unterst\u00fctzung dieser Warehouses erforderlichen Clouddienste verwenden. Sie k\u00f6nnen einen Ressourcenmonitor auch so einrichten, dass ein benutzerverwaltetes virtuelles Warehouse angehalten wird, wenn ein bestimmtes Credit-Limit erreicht ist.\nDie Anzahl der verbrauchten Credits h\u00e4ngt von der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des Warehouses und der Ausf\u00fchrungsdauer ab. Weitere Informationen zur Credit-Nutzung von Warehouses finden Sie unter Credit-Nutzung f\u00fcr virtuelle Warehouses .\n ... \nSection Title: Verwenden von Ressourcenmonitoren \u00b6 > Eigenschaften von Ressourcenmonitoren \u00b6 > Credit-Kontingent \u00b6\nContent:\nDas Credit-Kontingent gibt die Anzahl der Snowflake-Credits an, die dem Monitor f\u00fcr das angegebene Frequenzintervall zugewiesen wurden. Es kann eine beliebige Zahl angegeben werden.\nAu\u00dferdem verfolgt Snowflake die *verbrauchten Credits/Kontingente* innerhalb des angegebenen Frequenzintervalls von allen dem Monitor zugewiesenen Warehouses. Nach dem angegebenen Intervall wird diese Zahl auf `0` zur\u00fcckgesetzt.\nDas Credit-Kontingent ber\u00fccksichtigt Credits, die sowohl von benutzerverwalteten virtuellen Warehouses als auch von virtuellen Warehouses, die von Clouddiensten verwendet werden, verbraucht werden.\nIhr Ressourcenmonitorlimit ist zum Beispiel auf 1.000 Credits eingestellt. Wenn Ihr Warehouse innerhalb eines bestimmten Intervalls oder Zeitraums 300 Credits verbraucht und Clouddienste 700 Credits verbrauchen, wird eine Warnung ausgel\u00f6st.\nBemerkung\nSection Title: Verwenden von Ressourcenmonitoren \u00b6 > Eigenschaften von Ressourcenmonitoren \u00b6 > Credit-Kontingent \u00b6\nContent:\nDie Grenzwerte f\u00fcr den Ressourcenmonitor ber\u00fccksichtigen nicht die t\u00e4gliche Anpassung von 10 % f\u00fcr Clouddienste. Snowflake verwendet den gesamten Credit-Verbrauch der Clouddiensteschicht, um zu berechnen, ob ein Grenzwert erreicht wurde, auch wenn dieser Verbrauch nie in Rechnung gestellt wird. Weitere Informationen zur Berechnung von Credits und zu Anpassungen f\u00fcr Clouddienste finden Sie unter Erl\u00e4uterungen zur Abrechnung der Nutzung von Clouddiensten .\nAnweisungen zum Anzeigen der Credit-Nutzung Ihrer Clouddienste finden Sie unter Untersuchen der Computekosten .\n ... \nSection Title: Verwenden von Ressourcenmonitoren \u00b6 > Eigenschaften von Ressourcenmonitoren \u00b6 > Zeitplan \u00b6\nContent:\nDer Standardzeitplan eines Ressourcenmonitors gibt an, dass er sofort mit der \u00dcberwachung der Credit-Nutzung beginnt und die verbrauchten Credits zu Beginn jedes Kalendermonats (d. h. zu Beginn des Standardabrechnungszyklus von Snowflake) auf `0` zur\u00fccksetzt.\nSie k\u00f6nnen den Zeitplan f\u00fcr einen Ressourcenmonitor jedoch optional mithilfe der folgenden Eigenschaften anpassen:\nFrequenz :\nDas Intervall, in dem die verwendeten Credits relativ zum angegebenen Startdatum zur\u00fcckgesetzt werden.\nUnterst\u00fctzte Werte:\nT\u00e4glich\nW\u00f6chentlich\nMonatlich\nJ\u00e4hrlich\nNie (verbrauchte Credits werden nie zur\u00fcckgesetzt; zugewiesene Warehouses verwenden weiterhin Credits, bis das Credit-Kontingent erreicht ist)\nStart :\nDatum und Uhrzeit (d. h.

        "[Snowflake](https://nimbusintelligence.com/category/snowflake/)\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor\nContent:\nBy [Luca Balduzzi](https://nimbusintelligence.com/author/luca-balduzzinimbusintelligence-com/ \"Posts by Luca Balduzzi\") September 15, 2023 September 30th, 2023 [2 Comments](https://nimbusintelligence.com/2023/09/snowflake-resource-monitor/)\n[Home](https://nimbusintelligence.com/) \u00bb [Blogposts](https://nimbusintelligence.com/blogposts/) \u00bb Snowflake Resource Monitor\nThe Snowflake **Resource Monitor** can be used to **control warehouse credit usage** , avoiding unexpected behaviors. When executing queries on the Snowflake platform, virtual warehouses are exploited to retrieve answers and, by doing so, Snowflake credits are consumed. Credits are used to pay for the processing time/power used by each *virtual warehouse* . If desired, the *warehouse* can be suspended when it reaches a credit limit.\nLimits can be set for specific intervals or date ranges and when reached, they can trigger various actions such as notifications or warehouse shut down.\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Resource Monitor Properties > Credit Quota\nContent:\nSpecifies the number of credits allocated to the monitor and can be any (reasonable, if you don\u2019t want to spend billions) number. If a specified interval is given, it resets back to 0 at the end of it.\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Resource Monitor Properties > Credit Quota > Monitor Level\nContent:\nThis setting specifies if the Resource Monitor should monitor the credit usage of the entire *Account* or a specific set of *virtual warehouses* assigned to it. The Resource Monitor is dormant if this property is not set, so basically this option is required.\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Resource Monitor Properties > Credit Quota > Schedule\nContent:\nIf this option is not set, the Resource Monitor starts monitoring credit usage right away and credits reset back to 0 at the beginning of the standard Snowflake billing cycle, which is the calendar month.\nScheduling can further be tuned to achieve specific objectives by setting the following properties:\n**Frequency** the interval at which the used credits reset according to the start date. Possible values are:\nDaily\nWeekly\nMonthly\nYearly\n**Start** date and time when the monitoring starts. Supported values are:\nImmediately\nTimestamp\n**End** date and time when Snowflake suspends the warehouses associated with the Resource Monitor, regardless of whether the credits exceeded a threshold. Needs to be a timestamp.\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Resource Monitor Properties > Credit Quota > Actions\nContent:\nActions (or triggers) are defined using the percentage of the credit quota assigned to the Resource Monitor and are executed upon reaching the specified threshold. Supported actions are:\n**Notify and Suspend** send a notification to all account administrators and suspend all assigned *warehouses* (after all statements being executed by the warehouses have completed). Basically it warns you that credits are ending\n**Notify and Suspend Immediately** send a notification to all account administrators and suspend all assigned *warehouses* immediately, regardless of any statements being executed. That\u2019s the red button: just shut everything down because you don\u2019t want to take out a mortgage to pay Snowflake\n**Notify** send an alert notification to all *account administrators*\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Resource Monitor Properties > Resource Monitors and Warehouses\nContent:\nA Resource Monitor can be set at the *account* level or at multiple *warehouses* to control credit usage. However, a *warehouse* can only be assigned to a single Resource Monitor below the account level.\nBased on the example in the image above, we can say that:\nThe credit quota for the account is 5000 and it\u2019s controlled by Resource Monitor 1. When this quota is reached all the actions defined for the RM are enforced to all five warehouses\nWarehouse 3 can consume a maximum of 1000 credits and it is assigned to Resource Monitor 2\nWarehouse 4 and 5 can consume a maximum combined total of 2500 credits and are assigned to Resource Monitor 3\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Resource Monitor Properties > Resource Monitors and Warehouses\nContent:\nIt is notable that the actual credits consumed by *warehouses* 3, 4 and 5 may be less than the *account* quota if it is reached first, because RM 1 also monitors *warehouse* 1 and 2, so if the maximum combined total of all *warehouses* is 5000, *warehouses* are shut down.\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > ... > Warehouse Suspension and Resumption\nContent:\nUsed credits for a Snowflake Resource Monitor reflects the sum of credits consumed by all assigned *warehouses* within the specified interval, along with the *cloud services* used to support those *warehouses* during the same interval.\nIf a monitor reaches his credit threshold and one of *Suspend* or *Suspend Immediately* actions were set for it, any *warehouse* assigned to the monitor is suspended. Each suspended warehouse can\u2019t be resumed until some conditions happen:\nthe next interval, if any, starts, as dictated by the start date of the monitor\nthe credit quota for the monitor is increased\nthe credit threshold for the suspend action is increased\nthe warehouses are no longer assigned to the monitor\nthe monitor is dropped\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Overview on Costs > Compute Resources Cost\nContent:\nUsing compute resources within Snowflake consumes credits. The billed cost of using *compute resources* is calculated by multiplying the number of consumed credits by the price of a credit. Credits have different costs, depending on the type of *warehouse* you choose. To learn more about this click [here](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\nThere are three types of compute resources that consume credits within Snowflake:\nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Overview on Costs > Compute Resources Cost\nContent:\n**Virtual Warehouse Compute** : *Virtual warehouses* are user-managed compute resources that consume credits when performing operations. Because Snowflake utilizes per-second billing, warehouses are billed only for the credits they actually consume when they are actively working. Note that a 60-second minimum period each time the *warehouse* starts is applied. **Serverless Compute** : There are Snowflake features such as *Search Optimization* and *Snowpipe* that use Snowflake-managed compute resources rather than *virtual warehouses* . To minimize cost, these *serverless compute* resources are automatically resized and scaled up or down by Snowflake as required for each workload. **Cloud Services Compute** : The *cloud services* layer of the Snowflake architecture consumes credits as it performs behind-the-scenes tasks.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Resource Monitor > Overview on Costs > Compute Resources Cost > References\nContent:\nSnowflake Documentation: https://docs.snowflake.com/\n[Luca Balduzzi](https://nimbusintelligence.com/author/luca-balduzzinimbusintelligence-com/ \"Luca Balduzzi\") : AuthorEnterprising guy that happens to be also very flexible to the environment, thanks to previous working experiences with clients.
