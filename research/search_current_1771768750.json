More specifically, it involves identifying valuable data and either [selling that data to others](https://www.snowflake.com/en/fundamentals/uniting-data-providers-apps-and-marketplaces-for-business-intelligence/) , using that data for direct marketing or leveraging data-based products to create new revenue streams.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Why Is Data Monetization Important?\nContent:\nWhile monetizing data used to be exclusive to the world of tech giants and global conglomerates with sophisticated data science programs, today the world of data monetization has become democratized. Any organization looking to thrive can now create a data monetization strategy, using it to open up new revenue streams, enhance the customer experience or gain a competitive advantage in its industry, whether it\u2019s [telecommunications](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/telecom/) , [financial services](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/financial-services/) , [media](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/advertising-media-entertainment/) or something else.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\nContent:\nSo you want to start turning data into value in your own organization? Organizations can take one or more strategic pathways on the road to monetizing data. The correct path depends on your organization\u2019s industry, your business goals and the type of data you have available. Here are the four primary strategies that organizations can use to monetize their data assets. #### 1. Selling raw or aggregated data Perhaps the most foundational type of data monetization, the simplest method to turn data into money is to sell it directly, for example on a [marketplace](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/marketplace/snowflake-marketplace-for-providers/) .\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\nContent:\nData about your customers has value to other businesses who want to reach them, either in the form of customer records with detailed contact information and data around their purchasing habits \u2014 or in the aggregate, where information is anonymized and consolidated through statistical methods. Raw customer data tends to be more valuable since it can be used as a direct sales lead, but this kind of data is subject to myriad privacy laws globally and may require customers to \u201copt in\u201d to data sharing. This data can also be anonymized to disguise the actual identity of the customer ( [data clean rooms](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/data-clean-rooms/) can be a helpful tool for this sort of task, for example). Aggregated data, which does not include personally identifiable information about the customer, carries less of a compliance risk, but typically also holds less value.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\nContent:\nIn either case, a data monetization market can be helpful as an additional revenue stream. #### 2. Offering \"Data as a Service\" (DaaS) Data as a Service is an emerging business model that makes data available to customers on demand. DaaS services may be built around similar data types to those outlined in the previous section, but DaaS can offer advantages in both speed and data quality. With DaaS, data is available at the ready for customers to access any time and in an API-enabled format that can integrate directly into a workflow. DaaS systems also often include automated data management tools that improve data integrity and quality over what traditional data platforms (such as CRM systems) can offer. #### 3. Providing analytics and insights If you can\u2019t (or don\u2019t want to) sell the data itself, you can analyze that data and sell information derived from it.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\nContent:\nThis is of course the primary business model for analyst firms, which collect data and then sell the reports they generate after analyzing it. Insights into customer and market trends can be of great value to other companies operating in the same industry or a related one. #### 4. Offering data-enhanced products and services A final data monetization strategy is to use data to upgrade the products or services you already provide or to improve the way they are sold. This could take the form of creating a personalized product, such as a bespoke fitness program designed for an individual customer based on data about their particular health needs. Or it could include designing upsell/cross-sell activities, such as the data-driven recommendations to purchase related products that are common on online [retail](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/retail-consumer-goods/) websites.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Key Challenges of Data Monetization\nContent:\nData monetization does not come without its share of challenges, some of which can be daunting. The most notable challenges include: #### Data privacy and governance Arguably both the most difficult and the most common obstacle to monetizing data, the tangle of privacy laws and regulations worldwide that govern the way customer information is stored and shared can trouble even the most seasoned organizations. Failure to comply with data privacy rules can lead to stiff penalties and loss of reputation \u2014 even if the failure is accidental. Ensuring the highest levels of [governance](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/horizon/) over customer data is paramount for any data monetization effort. #### Identifying valuable data assets How do you know data has value?\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Key Challenges of Data Monetization\nContent:\nMany organizations undertake monetization strategies only to find out after substantial work has been done that there\u2019s no market for the data or that the value of the data is less than expected. Understanding whether the end result of a data monetization effort is likely to bear financial fruit must be a key first step in any undertaking. #### Data quality and standardization Many organizations may have a treasure trove of data, only for further analysis to reveal that data is incomplete, poor in quality or stored in inconsistent, incompatible formats. Data that is improperly cleansed and standardized ahead of a monetization effort is likely to lead to a poor end result.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Use Cases and Examples of Data Monetization\nContent:\nExamples of successful data monetization initiatives are all around us. Here are some key use cases where organizations are finding success with the business strategy. #### In retail Retail is one of the heaviest users of data monetization, because the industry habitually collects a large amount of very valuable data. Retailers leverage data monetization daily by suggesting additional items for shoppers to buy after purchasing a product. And those famously long CVS receipts with coupons at the bottom? Those aren\u2019t random \u2014 [they\u2019re tied to items the customer is likely to purchase next](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/business/cvs-receipts-long-extracare-rewards) , enticing them to return on another day.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Use Cases and Examples of Data Monetization\nContent:\nMany [retailers](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/retail-media-data-clean-room-assets-permissions/) , especially grocery stores, use loyalty programs to closely track what a customer buys, helping them plan promotions and optimize inventory. #### In financial services All those credit card offers you receive in the mail aren\u2019t generated arbitrarily. They\u2019re the result of financially driven data monetization strategies that target customers based on an analysis of their purchasing habits and credit history. Data models can help prioritize the customers with the highest potential value and the lowest risk, and financial institutions use this data to target those customers with personalized financial products.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Use Cases and Examples of Data Monetization\nContent:\nPayment processors also commonly aggregate transaction data and sell this information to merchants and manufacturers to help them create targeted [marketing](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/departments/marketing/) campaigns. #### In manufacturing [Manufacturers](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/manufacturing/) can collect data about the way their products are used and sell it to companies in complementary industries. For example, automakers can sell information about driving habits collected by onboard computers to fuel companies and tire manufacturers. An equipment manufacturer can gather information about how its products are performing in the field and use that information to offer service plans designed to provide preventive maintenance.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Use Cases and Examples of Data Monetization\nContent:\nRegardless of your organization\u2019s industry, data monetization can be a strong benefit \u2014 especially if you have the right tooling in place to manage and govern the data you want to monetize.\n ... \nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Data Monetization Resources\nContent:\n[feature ##### Snowflake Data Clean Rooms Explore the feature](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/data-clean-rooms/)\n[feature ##### Snowflake Horizon Catalog Explore the feature](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/horizon/)\n[feature ##### Snowflake Marketplace for Consumers Explore the feature](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/marketplace/snowflake-marketplace-for-providers/)\n[ebook ##### 50 Essential Apps, AI and Data Products on Snowflake Marketplace Get the ebook](https://www.snowflake.com/en/lp/essential-apps-ai-data-products/)\n[ebook ##### Snowflake Marketplace Guide 2025: Financial Services Get the ebook](https://www.snowflake.com/resource/snowflake-marketplace-guide-financial-services/)\n ... \nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Where Data Does More\nContent:\nLearn * [Resource Library](https://snowflake.com/en/resources/)\nLive Demos\n[Fundamentals](https://www.snowflake.com/en/fundamentals/)\n[Training](https://www.snowflake.com/en/resources/learn/training/)\n[Certifications](https://www.snowflake.com/en/resources/learn/certifications/)\n[Snowflake University](https://learn.snowflake.com/en/)\n[Developer Guides](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides)\n[Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/)\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.snowflake.com/en/legal/privacy/privacy-policy/)\n[Site Terms](https://snowflake.com/en/legal/snowflake-site-terms/)\n[Communication Preferences](https://info.snowflake.com/2024-Preference-center.html)\nCookie Settings\n[Do Not Share My Personal Information](https://www.snowflake.com/en/legal/privacy/privacy-policy/)\n[Legal](https://www.snowflake.com/en/legal/)\n[](https://x.com/Snowflake \"X (Twitter)\")\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/3653845 \"LinkedIn\")"

It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Principles > Business impact: Align cost with business value\nContent:\nConnect cloud spending directly to business outcomes, ensuring that every dollar spent in the cloud contributes meaningfully to strategic objectives and demonstrable value. Embed cost considerations directly into platform planning and architecture considerations.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Recommendations\nContent:\nFurthermore, you should establish a regular cadence for refreshing\nthis measurement to ensure value realization is in line with\nexpectations and business goals. **Visibility**\n**Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models:** Review\nSnowflake\u2019s billing models to align technical and non-technical\nresources on financial drivers and consumption terminology. **Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy:** Implement robust and organizationally consistent tagging and\nlabeling strategies across all resources (storage objects,\nwarehouses, accounts, queries) to accurately allocate costs to\nspecific teams, products, or initiatives. **Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA:** Implement a feedback system to transparently show or charge back\ncloud costs to relevant business units or teams, increasing\naccountability.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Business Impact > Overview > Consider cost as a design constraint\nContent:\nAt the ingestion layer, best practices include balancing latency versus\ncost by selecting appropriate services (e.g., Snowpipe, Snowpipe\nStreaming, or third-party tools) and choosing the right storage format\n(e.g., native tables, Iceberg). For transformations, design with\nfrequency versus SLA in mind to ensure data freshness matches the\nbusiness need. For analytics, apply schema design best practices such as\nthoughtful clustering key choices and pruning strategies to reduce\nconsumed credits. In distribution, optimize data transfer by monitoring\negress patterns and applying cost-saving practices like the [Snowflake Data Transfer Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) .\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nImplementing robust and organizationally consistent tagging and labeling\nstrategies across all resources (e.g. storage objects, warehouses,\naccounts, queries) is crucial to accurately allocate costs to specific\nteams, products, or initiatives and linking actions to outcomes.\n**Tagging in Snowflake**\nTagging can be done at several levels:\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nThis\nsignificantly reduces the manual effort required for tagging and\nensures that new objects created within a tagged schema or propagated\nworkflow automatically inherit the correct cost attribution. Snowflake\nstrongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\nto enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\nWAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS to allocate usage\nto relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\nSnowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Query tags for granular workload attribution:** [Query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) can be set via session parameters (e.g., ALTER SESSION SET QUERY_TAG =\n'your_tag';) or directly within SQL clients or ETL tools. This\nassociates individual queries with specific departments, projects, or\napplications, even when using shared warehouses. This is extremely\nvaluable for shared warehouses where multiple teams or applications\nuse the same compute resource, allowing for granular showback. It is\nalso easy to programmatically make changes to query tags within\nscripts or processes to allocate costs appropriately. Query tags can\nbe found in the QUERY_HISTORY view of the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE\nschema.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits. Review each model before deploying resources. If an\norganization is caught between models, a common approach is to start in\na shared resource environment and graduate to dedicated resources as the\nworkload increases.\n**Tag enforcement**\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nClear and consistent naming conventions for accounts, warehouses,\ndatabases, schemas, and tables facilitate immediate cost understanding. Enforcing robust tagging policies (e.g., requiring specific tags for new\nresource creation and using automated scripts to identify untagged\nresources) is crucial for accurate data interpretation and effective\ncost management. Without tag enforcement, it is difficult to accurately\nallocate all costs and can require manual effort, like extensive\ntag-mapping tables. Tag values are enforced within an account, but if a\nmulti-account strategy is needed for your organization, a tag [database can be replicated](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) and leveraged across all accounts to ensure consistent values are used.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nFor best-in-class visibility, it is recommended to have a tagging\nstrategy and tag all resources in an organization to allocate costs to\nrelevant owners.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA\nContent:\nFor more financially mature organizations, a chargeback model can be\nvery effective for managing costs. This system directly bills\ndepartments for their Snowflake usage. This creates a powerful financial\nincentive for teams to optimize their workloads. To make this transition\nsmooth and fair, you need to define clear rules for cost allocation. By\nimplementing chargeback, you turn each department into a financial\nstakeholder, encouraging them to right-size their warehouses, suspend\nthem during idle periods, and write more efficient queries. This shift\nin accountability leads to a more disciplined and cost-effective use of\nyour Snowflake environment.\nIn either case, having a centralized dashboard or visual for all\norganizations to review intra-period is critical for financial\naccountability and next-step actions.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Track usage data for all platform resources**\nTo deliver clear and actionable consumption insights, it is essential to\nleverage the rich usage data that Snowflake natively provides. The\nfoundation for all cost visibility is the **SNOWFLAKE** database, which\ncontains two key schemas for this purpose: [ACCOUNT_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) (for granular, account-level data) and [ORGANIZATION_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage) (for a consolidated view across all accounts).\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\nBusiness Metrics link cloud spending to meaningful business outcomes and\nvalue drivers. These KPIs are essential for executives, finance teams,\nand product managers to understand the return on investment (ROI) of\ncloud expenditure and to allocate costs accurately across different\nparts of the organization. They answer the critical question: \"What\nbusiness value are we getting for our cloud spend?\" Examples include:\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Snowsight's built-in cost management capabilities:** Snowsight\nprovides pre-built visuals for usage and credit monitoring directly\nwithin the [Snowflake Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) . It allows filtering by tags (e.g., view cost by department tag),\ncredit consumption by object types, and cost insights to optimize the\nplatform. **Creating custom dashboards or Streamlit apps for different stakeholder groups:** Snowsight facilitates the creation of custom\ndashboards using ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE views. Custom\ncharts in the Dashboards feature and Streamlit apps can both be easily\nshared. Combined with cost allocation and tagging, this allows for\ntailored views for finance managers (aggregated spend), engineering\nmanagers (warehouse utilization), or data analysts (query\nperformance).\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Integrating with third-party BI tools for advanced analytics:** Connecting to Snowflake from tools like Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or\ncustom applications offers highly customizable and extensive control\nover cost data visualization. Cloud-specific third-party data programs\n(FinOps platforms) offer easier setup and more out-of-the-box\nSnowflake cost optimization insights. **Leverage Cortex Code (In Preview):** This AI Assistant capability\nallows users to query cost and usage data in ACCOUNT_USAGE views using\nnatural language natively in the Snowsight UI.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Proactively monitor all platform usage\nContent:\nTo establish effective budgets, it's crucial to define [roles and privileges](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) by configuring the role, team, or user responsible for the resources.\nThis ensures that budget tracking aligns with specific business units or\nprojects, enabling accurate cost attribution and accountability. By\nlinking consumption to the relevant stakeholders, you can create a clear\nshowback or chargeback model, which is vital for fostering a sense of\nownership over spending. This configuration should be part of a broader,\nconsistent tagging strategy to ensure all costs are properly allocated\nto departments, environments, or projects.\n**Create budget categories**\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Optimize > Overview > Limit data transfer\nContent:\nData egress, the transfer of data from one cloud provider or region to\nanother, can incur substantial costs, particularly when handling large\ndata volumes. Implementing appropriate tools and best practices is\nessential to minimize these data transfer expenses and maximize business\nvalue when data egress is necessary.\n**Tooling: Enable proactive cost management**\nLeverage Snowflake's native features to gain visibility and control over\ndata transfer costs before they become a significant expense."

It lets teams spin up warehouses on demand without worrying about infrastructure management or upfront hardware costs. They can also handle workloads that would crush many traditional databases.\nBut this flexibility cuts both ways. The same architecture makes it easy to drive costs up without anyone noticing until the bill arrives.\nAnd to prevent overspending, you need detailed visibility. That\u2019s what a Snowflake cost management tool provides. It helps you understand what\u2019s causing overspending while also guiding you on how to trim it.\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll introduce you to the 4 best Snowflake cost management tools. You\u2019ll learn about their capabilities and what to look for when choosing one of them for your environment.\n ... \nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Can I just use Snowflake native cost tools?\nContent:\nSnowflake does include built-in features to help manage spend, but these tools only go so far. So why invest in a third-party Snowflake cost-management platform?\nHere\u2019s what Snowflake natively provides:\n**Resource Monitors:** These let you set credit limits on warehouses or your entire account. You can configure them to watch credit usage and optionally suspend warehouses when usage hits a defined limit.\n**Budgets:** These let admins set monthly credit-spending limits and get alerts when projected spending is about to exceed. The spending limits can be set for your account or custom groups of objects.\nNow, let\u2019s return to our question: why not use native Snowflake tools?\nThe problem is that these native tools operate more like safety nets than management or optimization engines.\nThey don\u2019t help you understand why costs climbed. They can only inform you when spending has already reached a dangerous level.\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Can I just use Snowflake native cost tools?\nContent:\nTake Resource Monitors: they can tell you a warehouse exceeded its quota, but they can\u2019t explain **why** . They don\u2019t surface inefficient queries, runaway workloads, or which teams and users are driving the spike.\nSnowflake also doesn\u2019t automatically map warehouse or query usage to business units, cost centers, or environments. This makes accurate cost allocation slow, manual, and often incomplete.\nIf you want to track Snowflake alongside the rest of your cloud ecosystem such as AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, or other SaaS data tools, native Snowflake features cannot provide unified visibility.\nFor organizations with multiple teams, fast-growing workloads, or high Snowflake usage, native tools cannot deliver the visibility, automation, or intelligence required to proactively manage spend.\nA third-party Snowflake cost management platform fills those gaps by offering:\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Can I just use Snowflake native cost tools?\nContent:\n**Full cost visibility and attribution** across teams and workloads\n**Intelligent forecasting** that predicts spend before it spikes\n**Automated alerts and anomaly detection** that highlight issues in real time\nIn short, Snowflake shows you what you spent. A third-party Snowflake management tool explains why it happened and how to reduce it.\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > ... > 1. Ternary\nContent:\nTernary is a multi-cloud FinOps platform. It gives you cost visibility and control across cloud and SaaS solutions, including Snowflake.\nTernary\u2019s [Snowflake insights](https://ternary.app/integrations/snowflake/) shows you query counts, run times, and the type and number of credits used over a given period, broken down by account and warehouses. With these insights, you can easily spot inefficiencies that don\u2019t become obvious from a billing summary alone.\nFor example, if someone accidentally overprovisions a warehouse or if query performance starts dragging due to underprovisioning, Ternary will bring both to your attention.\nWith [Ternary\u2019s reporting engine](https://ternary.app/platform/finops-reporting-engine/) you can build custom Snowflake reports for specific teams or business units easily. You can also allocate costs to the appropriate areas of your organization to determine the total cost of ownership accurately.\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > ... > 1. Ternary\nContent:\nThe platform provides industry-leading capabilities across anomaly detection, budget management, cost allocation, and forecasting, making it a great tool for organizations that require cost management and optimization across their entire infrastructure.\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > ... > 2. Select.dev\nContent:\n[ [Source](https://select.dev/) ]\nSelect.dev is a dedicated Snowflake cost management platform. Its two main functions are Snowflake observability and optimization. Like Ternary, it also gives you a detailed visibility into credits down to individual queries, workloads, users, and teams.\nIn addition to providing visibility, it also continuously analyzes your account to inform you about optimization opportunities.\nThere\u2019s also support for automatic warehouse adjustments. For example, it can scale virtual warehouses up or down based on actual usage patterns with zero intervention from you.\nYou can also allocate costs to specific teams or projects, then set budget thresholds for them so they feel accountable for their spending.\nSelect.dev has built-in [anomaly detection](https://ternary.app/platform/anomaly-detection/) too, which informs you about spikes through channels like Slack and email.\n ... \nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > ... > Look for granular cost allocation\nContent:\nMake sure the tool you\u2019re considering allows you to attribute costs by:\nProject\nTeam\nDepartment\nWarehouse\nWorkload\nPrecise [cost allocation](https://ternary.app/platform/cloud-cost-allocation/) creates accountable teams that spend responsibly.\nThis level of detail is what prevents guesswork during budget reviews. Without proper allocation, most organizations end up chasing numbers at the end of the month, trying to figure out who consumed what.\nA strong allocation model also helps teams understand the financial impact of their daily work, which naturally leads to better resource planning. If a platform cannot break down spend in a way that mirrors your internal structure, you\u2019ll struggle to identify the real drivers behind your Snowflake bill.\n ... \nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Final thoughts\nContent:\nSnowflake is already a powerful platform. But at the end of the day, it still needs the right guardrails to stay cost-efficient.\nA Snowflake cost management platform gives you those guardrails. Ternary provides the visibility your team needs to manage Snowflake spending with confidence.\nSo if you want clarity on your Snowflake costs, get started with Ternary.\n**Explore Ternary\u2019s Snowflake functionality.**\n[Book a demo](https://ternary.app/demo/)\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Related articles\nContent:\n[](https://ternary.app/blog/snowflake-cost-optimization/) Blog [Snowflake cost optimization: 8 proven strategies for reducing costs](https://ternary.app/blog/snowflake-cost-optimization/)\n[](https://ternary.app/blog/manage-your-snowflake-costs/) Blog [Harness Snowflake\u2019s power\u2014without the pain](https://ternary.app/blog/manage-your-snowflake-costs/)\n[](https://ternary.app/blog/everest-group-leader-2025/) Blog [Everest Group names Ternary a 2025 FinOps Leader](https://ternary.app/blog/everest-group-leader-2025/)\n[](https://ternary.app/)\nAvailable as a SaaS platform and a self-hosted solution, Ternary manages more than $7.5B in multi-cloud spend across leading enterprises and managed service providers.\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ternaryinc/) [](https://twitter.com/ternaryinc) [](https://www.youtube.com/@ternaryinc)\nPlatform\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Related articles\nContent:\n[Overview](https://ternary.app/platform/overview/)\n[Why Ternary](https://ternary.app/platform/why-ternary/)\n[Anomaly detection](https://ternary.app/platform/anomaly-detection/)\n[Cost allocation](https://ternary.app/platform/cloud-cost-allocation/)\n[Cloud cost optimization](https://ternary.app/platform/cloud-cost-optimization/)\n[Forecasting](https://ternary.app/platform/cloud-cost-forecasting/)\n[Reporting Engine](https://ternary.app/platform/finops-reporting-engine/)\nIntegrations\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Related articles\nContent:\n[Integrations](https://ternary.app/integrations/)\n[Alibaba Cloud](https://ternary.app/integrations/alibaba-cloud/)\n[AWS](https://ternary.app/integrations/aws/)\n[Azure](https://ternary.app/integrations/azure/)\n[Bring Your Own Data](https://ternary.app/integrations/bring-your-own-data/)\n[FOCUS](https://ternary.app/integrations/focus/)\n[Google Cloud](https://ternary.app/integrations/google-cloud-gcp/)\n[Kubernetes](https://ternary.app/integrations/kubernetes/)\n[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://ternary.app/integrations/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-oci/)\n[Snowflake](https://ternary.app/integrations/snowflake/)\nSolutions\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Related articles\nContent:\n[For FinOps teams](https://ternary.app/solutions/finops/)\n[For Engineers](https://ternary.app/solutions/engineers/)\n[For Finance](https://ternary.app/solutions/finance/)\n[For MSPs](https://ternary.app/partners/msps/)\n[For Financial Services](https://ternary.app/solutions/financial-services/)\n[For Healthcare & Life Sciences](https://ternary.app/solutions/healthcare-life-sciences/)\n[For Manufacturing](https://ternary.app/solutions/manufacturing/)\n[For Media & Entertainment](https://ternary.app/solutions/media-entertainment/)\n[For Public Sector](https://ternary.app/solutions/finops-for-public-sector/)\n[For Retail & Consumer Goods](https://ternary.app/solutions/retail/)\n[For AI cost management](https://ternary.app/solutions/ai-cost-management/)\nResources\n ... \nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Related articles\nContent:\n[About](https://ternary.app/about-us/)\n[Careers](https://ternary.app/careers/)\n[News](https://ternary.app/news/)\n[Contact us](https://ternary.app/contact/)\n[End User License Agreement](https://ternary.app/eula/)\n[Privacy policy](https://ternary.app/privacy-policy/)\n[LLM info](https://ternary.app/llm-info/)"

        "Section Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nMarketplace Monetization allows providers to sell their products to Snowflake customers and invoice them directly through Snowflake. Because they\u2019re purchasing through an already-known vendor, customers can avoid the potentially lengthy process of vetting, onboarding and verifying security policies for a new vendor and start using the data products right away. Shortening the sales, procurement and contracting cycle translates into faster time to value \u2014 which is good news for both customers and providers. Customers can also easily pay their Snowflake Marketplace invoice via electronic fund transfer, credit card payment or even with their Snowflake capacity commitment (via [Marketplace Capacity Drawdown](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/consumer-listings-paying) for eligible customers). The customer\u2019s monetary payment is disbursed directly to the provider. Pricing is, of course, controlled and defined by the provider.\nSection Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nIt can be custom and privately available/visible for select customers, or be made more general for standardized products that are publicly available. Snowflake offers a multitude of monetization models from pay-as-you-go usage that is based on consumption to all-you-can-eat subscription-based models. No matter which model they use, providers can port their pricing and monetization strategy directly to Snowflake without worrying about pricing strategy mismatch across channels. (Please note: Snowflake currently only supports USD-based pricing for Marketplace Monetization.) Understandably, customers may hesitate to pay for a data product without a chance to \u201ckick the tires\u201d a bit and properly evaluate the solution. Snowflake Marketplace takes care of this with several options to allow customers to try out a listing before purchasing: * Time-limited trials\nSection Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nLimited functionality trials, analogous to the \u201cfreemium\u201d model common to SaaS products\nUsage-based trials (currently in private preview)\nMany successful providers publish public paid listings with free trials on Snowflake Marketplace to create awareness with new and existing customers. This strategy allows them to address the self-service customer segments while still generating leads for upselling and creating opportunities for private conversations about customized products. One of the most valuable features of Snowflake\u2019s monetization capabilities, in my opinion, is that Snowflake shares end-to-end analytics back to providers.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > What monetization models are available?\nContent:\nThere are two monetization models available: usage-based and subscription. Our [**usage-based pricing model**](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-pricing-model) allows providers to lower barriers to entry for consumers (also one of the reasons why Snowflake employs usage-based pricing). They can start using your products and get value immediately, without committing to long-term contracts. Examples here include pricing per query or per month when usage occurs. Snowflake Native Apps also have an exclusive usage-based pricing model: [custom event billing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-custom-event-billing) (currently in public preview). This API-based billing allows providers to charge and meter based on nearly any value their app offers. For example, you can specify billing events in your app code and charge consumers based entirely on their usage of your application.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Snowflake Native App Framework Now Generally Available on AWS and Azure\nContent:\nUnmesh Jagtap | Phoebe He\nJan 31, 2024 | 5 min read\nProduct and Technology\nSection Title: ... > 3 Reasons to Try and Buy Snowflake Native Apps on Snowflake Marketplace\nContent:\nTravis Kaufman\nJul 10, 2023 | 5 min read\nApplications"

        "Section Title: From App Store to Accelerator: How the Snowflake Marketplace helps solve Data's Significant Chall...\nContent:\nArticle\nNews\nJanuary 12, 2026\n|\nGirish Bhat\nFor data teams, the Snowflake AI Data Cloud presents a powerful paradigm: a platform with the elasticity to separate compute from storage, enabling innovation at a scale previously unimaginable.  The Snowflake Marketplace has evolved from a simple \"app store\" to a destination for AI, ML, vertical and horizontal applications that help manage and optimize modern data environments.\nManaging and optimizing modern data environments comes with critical challenges as many organizations find themselves struggling with soaring cloud data costs, unpredictable spend, lack of data quality and proper governance. Data teams are often trapped in a \"reactive firefighting\" mode, trying to manually tune performance, fix data quality issues, and control budgets all at once.\nSection Title: From App Store to Accelerator: How the Snowflake Marketplace helps solve Data's Significant Chall...\nContent:\nThe problem is that managing cost (FinOps) effectively and capabilities for managing performance and quality (DataOps) are limited in the Snowflake platform and have been separately sourced software tools. This creates a fundamental conflict with FinOps wanting to cut costs, while DataOps needing to ensure performance, often by using more resources and the platform does not expose the right controls.\nThis article highlights the strategic benefits of the Marketplace for Snowflake customers and highlights Revefi\u2019s AI Agent that leverages this ecosystem to solve the core challenges of cost, performance, data quality and complexity.\nSection Title: ... > The Advantages of the Snowflake Marketplace\nContent:\nThe Snowflake Marketplace has matured into a powerful lever for data teams by solving core challenges: data acquisition, application catalog, and procurement.\nSection Title: ... > Streamlined Procurement\nContent:\nThe Marketplace provides a powerful solution to one of the bottlenecks in B2B technology, i.e., proper solution and vendor procurement. The Snowflake platform streamlines purchasing with simplified billing.\n**Consolidated Invoicing:** Marketplace purchases appear on a separate Snowflake Marketplace invoice, centralizing data cloud spend.\n**Strategic Drawdown:** Customers can pay for listings using their **Marketplace Capacity Drawdown (MCD) Program funds** . This transforms what is often a multi-month new vendor procurement process into a simple, existing budget allocation, dramatically accelerating time-to-value.\nSection Title: ... > The 'Zero-Copy' Architecture: Access Without Overhead\nContent:\nThe foundation of the Marketplace is Snowflake's native **Secure Data Share** feature. When you access a dataset, the data is *not* copied or transferred via traditional ETL pipelines. Instead, you are given secure, read-only access to the provider's live, real-time data.\nThis \"zero-copy\" mechanism provides immediate, benefits:\n**No Integration Tax:** You avoid the costs of building and maintaining APIs and data pipelines.\n**Zero Storage Footprint:** Because no data is physically moved, the shared data doesn't take up any storage space in the consumer's account.\n**Direct Data Access** : Access to current data without latency from data transfer.\nSection Title: ... > The Native App Ecosystem\nContent:\nBeyond datasets, the Marketplace is a repository for **Snowflake Native Apps** which are pre-configured and tested applications that customers can deploy directly. A Native App runs inside your own Snowflake environment without your data ever leaving your governance perimeter. The application comes to the data, not the other way around. This model complies with existing governance policies, including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), data masking, and row-level security."

For additional information, see Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions .\nThis topic describes the costs associated with developing, publishing and using a\nSnowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. It contains information for both providers and consumers.\nSection Title: Costs associated with apps with containers \u00b6 > Costs to consumers \u00b6\nContent:\nA Snowflake Native App may incur costs in the consumer account. The total cost of running\na Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services is determined by the following:\nCosts determined by the provider\nInfrastructure costs\nSection Title: Costs associated with apps with containers \u00b6 > ... > Costs determined by the provider \u00b6\nContent:\nA provider may monetize a Snowflake Native App using any of the paid listing pricing models that are available in the Snowflake Marketplace. These models include subscription based and usage based plans.\nThis cost to the consumer is determined by the provider. Consumers pay for provider software via the Snowflake Marketplace in addition to costs associated with running Snowflake\ninfrastructure, including warehouses and compute pools.\n ... \nSection Title: Costs associated with apps with containers \u00b6 > Costs to consumers \u00b6 > Infrastructure costs \u00b6\nContent:\nSeparate charges for compute pool compute related to the Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services appear on the customer billing\nstatement. A consumer can determine the compute pool billing charges for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services using the ACCOUNT USAGE views provided by\nSnowpark Container Services.\nFor more details, such as the consumption table for compute pools, contact your account representative.\nSection Title: Costs associated with apps with containers \u00b6 > Costs to providers \u00b6\nContent:\nProviders can also incur costs when developing and maintaining a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services, including the\nfollowing:\nSection Title: Costs associated with apps with containers \u00b6 > Costs to providers \u00b6\nContent:\nProviders incur Snowpark Container Services compute costs associated with both initial development and\nongoing testing and support for their Snowflake Native App. The compute cost may be controlled through\norchestration of compute pools during provider-side development and testing.\nThe storage of container images can incur costs when a provider creates a new version or patch of\na Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. In this context, the Docker images that the app requires are copied into an image\nrepository that is not directly accessible or observable by the provider or the consumer.Services in the consumer account are created from the versioned images that are stored in this\nrepository. Providers are responsible for the storage costs for the images in this stage, which\nappear on their Snowflake bill. These costs are aggregated with other storage costs that their account incurs.\nWas this page helpful?\nSection Title: Costs associated with apps with containers \u00b6 > Costs to providers \u00b6\nContent:\nYes No\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\nShare your feedback\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\nOn this page\nCosts to consumers\nCosts to providers\nRelated content\nAbout the Snowflake Native App Framework"
