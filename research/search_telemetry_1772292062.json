This is especially true in a distributed system, where evidence collected from observation provides a view of\nbehavior across multiple components. Rather than disrupting a production environment to diagnose issues, you can analyze the collected\ndata from it.\nWith an observable system, you can start to answer questions such as the following:\nHow well is the system performing?\nWhere is there latency and what’s causing it?\nWhy is a particular component or process not working as it should?\nWhat improvements can be made?\nSection Title: Observability in Snowflake apps ¶ > Observability in Snowflake ¶\nContent:\nSnowflake supports a model that provides built-in observable data while also giving you ways to add more instrumentation where you need it.\nWhile Snowflake provides support for telemetry data such as logs, metrics, and traces (which are typical of observability), it also\nincludes other features you can use to keep track of system usage and performance.\nThe following lists features you can use to receive and analyze system performance and usage.\n|Collected telemetry data |As your application generates logs, metrics, and traces, Snowflake collects that telemetry data in an event table. Using\nSnowsight, you can explore the data, looking for patterns.\nYou can emit custom telemetry into the event table to provide contextual, domain-specific information to expedite debugging. |\n| --- | --- |\n|History Tables |Use the following views and their associated tables to monitor all usage in your account.\nSection Title: Observability in Snowflake apps ¶ > Observability in Snowflake ¶\nContent:\nQuery History\nCopy History\nTasks |\n|Alerts and notifications |Alerts allow for customizable triggering conditions, actions, and a schedule, in combination with notification integrations for proactive monitoring. |\n|Extensibility with third-party tools |The Snowflake event table adopts [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) standards, so your\nSnowflake telemetry can easily be consumed by other ecosystem tools. |\n ... \nSection Title: Observability in Snowflake apps ¶ > ... > Types of telemetry data ¶\nContent:\nTo ensure that the telemetry data you collect is broadly useful, Snowflake telemetry is built on the standard [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) (sometimes called OTel) framework, an incubating project of the Cloud Native Compute Foundation. Through this framework (and APIs and\ntools designed for it), you can reuse collected data with tools besides Snowflake .\nThrough OpenTelemetry, you can instrument application code to add observability where you want it.\nSnowflake event tables collect log, span, and metrics data in the OpenTelemetry data model. The following describes each type of telemetry\ndata collected in an event table.\n|Logs |Logs record individual operations performed by code.

It also enhances the developer experience by offering an integrated testing environment, allowing applications to be easily tested with a single account after installation or updates.\nSection Title: ... > What is the Snowflake Native App Framework?\nContent:\nWith the **Snowflake Native App Framework** , it is possible to create actual applications that run on Snowflake and can be easily deployed within or even outside your cooperation with the Snowflake Data Cloud. The framework allows sharing data applications, i.e., data and related business logic, with other Snowflake accounts (consumers) over the Snowflake Marketplace as public or private listings.

Here, a **provider** is a Snowflake user who wants to share data and application logic with other Snowflake users (consumers).\nProviders create an **application package** to share data and application logic with a consumer. An application package is created to encapsulate packaged data, application logic, metadata, and a setup script required by an application. It also contains information about versions and patch levels defined for the application.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Accessing Data of the Provider from the Snowflake Native App\nContent:\nINSERT INTO ingredients VALUES\n('Milk', ''),\n('Cheese', ''),\n('Egg', 'Eggs, Egg Whites, Yolk, Yolks'),\n('Butter', '');\n-- grant usage on the `ingredients` table\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA shared_data TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE IDENTIFIER($APP_PACKAGE);\nGRANT SELECT ON TABLE ingredients TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE IDENTIFIER($APP_PACKAGE); |\n| --- | --- |\nAfter creating the data within the application package and granting privileges, a view is added that allows the consumer to access the data.\nWhile consumers could select directly from the table, it’s better practice to use a view, as demonstrated in this application"]},{"url":"https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides/getting-started-with-snowflake-trail-for-observability/","title":"Getting Started with Snowflake Trail for Observability","excerpts":["Section Title: Getting Started with Snowflake Trail for Observability > Overview\nContent:\nSnowflake Trail is Snowflake's suite of observability capabilities that enable its users to better monitor, troubleshoot, debug and take actions on pipelines, apps, user code and compute utilizations.\nAs you can see above, Snowflake Trail utilizes core observability data — logs, metrics, traces, events, alerts, and notifications — to provide comprehensive workload monitoring across AI, applications, pipelines, and infrastructure.\nThis quickstart is intended to help tie together all the components of Snowflake Trail, and in turn, help you get started with Observability in Snowflake.
