When the parameter\nis set to a value greater than `0` , tasks are automatically suspended after the specified number of consecutive task runs either fail or time out.\nThe parameter can be set when creating a task using CREATE TASK or later using ALTER TASK . You can also change this value in Snowsight.\nThe SUSPEND_TASK_AFTER_NUM_FAILURES parameter can also be set at the account, database, or schema level.\nThe setting applies to all tasks contained in the modified object.\nNote that explicitly setting the parameter at a lower level overrides the parameter value set at a higher level.\nSection Title: Introduction to tasks ¶ > ... > Automatically retry failed task runs ¶\nContent:\nIf any task completes in a FAILED state, Snowflake can automatically retry the task.\nThe automatic task retry is disabled by default.\nTo enable this feature, set TASK_AUTO_RETRY_ATTEMPTS to a value greater than 0.\nTasks that use error notifications send notifications for each failed retry attempt.\nFor more information, see Configuring a task to send error notifications .\nWhen you set the TASK_AUTO_RETRY_ATTEMPTS parameter value at the account, database, or schema level, the change is applied to tasks contained in the modified object during their next scheduled run.\nSection Title: Introduction to tasks ¶ > Define additional session parameters ¶\nContent:\nA task supports all session parameters. For the complete list, see Parameters .\nTasks don’t support account or user parameters.\nTo set session parameters for a task, add the parameter to the task definition with CREATE TASK , or modify the task using ALTER TASK … SET . Examples:\n```\nCREATE TASK my_task \n  SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 * * * * UTC' \n  TIMESTAMP_INPUT_FORMAT = 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24' \n  USER_TASK_MANAGED_INITIAL_WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL' \n  AS \n    INSERT INTO mytable ( ts ) VALUES ( CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );\n```\nCopy\n```\nALTER TASK my_task \n  SET USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS = 10000  -- Changes maximum runtime to 10 seconds\n```\nCopy\n ... \nSection Title: Introduction to tasks ¶ > Task duration ¶ > Timeouts ¶\nContent:\nIf a task run exceeds the scheduled time or target completion interval, by default, the task continues to run until it is complete, it times out, or it fails.\nWhen both STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS and USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS are set, the timeout is the lowest non-zero value of the two parameters.\nWhen both STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS and USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS are set, the value of USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS takes precedence.\nFor information about timeouts with task graphs, see Task graph timeouts ."]},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-task","title":"CREATE TASK | Snowflake Documentation","excerpts":["Section Title: CREATE TASK ¶ > Optional parameters ¶\nContent:\nSEARCH_PATH set to any value.\nAUTOCOMMIT = FALSE .\n`USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS = _num_`\nSpecifies the time limit on a single run of the task before it times out (in milliseconds).\nNote\nBefore you increase the time limit on a task significantly, consider whether the SQL statement initiated by the task could be\noptimized (either by rewriting the statement or using a stored procedure) or the warehouse size should be increased.\nWhen both STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS and USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS are set, the timeout is the lowest non-zero value of the two parameters.\nWhen both STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS and USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS are set, the value of USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS takes precedence.\nFor more information about this parameter, see USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS .\nValues: `0` - `604800000` (7 days). A value of `0` specifies that the maximum timeout value is enforced.\nSection Title: CREATE TASK ¶ > Optional parameters ¶\nContent:\nDefault: `3600000` (1 hour) `SUSPEND_TASK_AFTER_NUM_FAILURES = _num_`\nSpecifies the number of consecutive failed task runs after which the current task is suspended automatically. Failed task runs\ninclude runs in which the SQL code in the task body either produces a user error or times out. Task runs that are skipped,\ncanceled, or that fail due to a system error are considered indeterminate and aren’t included in the count of failed task runs.\nSet the parameter on a standalone task or the root task in a task graph.

It is possible that the task ran successfully but the SQL statement in the task definition failed. In particular, note the scheduled and completed times, as well as any error code and message.\nIf the task has a predecessor task (in a task graph ), verify whether the predecessor task completed successfully.\n ... \nSection Title: Troubleshooting tasks ¶ > Task did not run ¶ > Step 5: Check predecessor tasks ¶\nContent:\nIf the task is a child task in a task graph, check that the predecessor tasks (parent tasks) ran to completion successfully. If A parent task failed to run to completion, any child tasks are skipped. For more information, see Create a sequence of tasks with a task graph .\nSection Title: Troubleshooting tasks ¶ > Task timed out or exceeded the schedule window ¶\nContent:\nThere is a 60 minute default limit on a single run of a task. This limitation was implemented as a safeguard against non-terminating tasks. Query the TASK_HISTORY table function. If the task was canceled or exceeded the window scheduled for the task, the cause is often an undersized warehouse. Review the warehouse size and consider increasing it to fit within the schedule window or the one-hour limit.\nAlternatively, consider increasing the timeout limit for the task by executing ALTER TASK … SET USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS = ** . To determine if the USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS parameter has been set for a specific task, execute the following statement:\n```\nSHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS' IN TASK <task_name> ;\n```\nCopy\nWhere `<task_name>` is the name of the task whose timeout limit you are adjusting. If the statement returns no record, the task currently has the default `3600000` millisecond (60 minute) timeout.\nSection Title: Troubleshooting tasks ¶ > Task timed out or exceeded the schedule window ¶\nContent:\nNote that neither increasing the warehouse size nor increasing the timeout limit might help if there are query parallelization issues. Consider looking at alternate ways to rewrite the SQL statement run by the task.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes No\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\nShare your feedback\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\nOn this page\nTask did not run\nTask timed out or exceeded the schedule window\nLanguage: **English**\nEnglish\nFrançais\nDeutsch\n日本語\n한국어\nPortuguês\n ... \nSection Title: Troubleshooting tasks ¶ > Privacy Preference Center > Your Privacy > Strictly Necessary Cookies\nContent:\nAlways Active\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off.
