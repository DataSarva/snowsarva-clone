It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Principles > Business impact: Align cost with business value\nContent:\nConnect cloud spending directly to business outcomes, ensuring that every dollar spent in the cloud contributes meaningfully to strategic objectives and demonstrable value. Embed cost considerations directly into platform planning and architecture considerations.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Business Impact > Overview > Consider cost as a design constraint\nContent:\nAt the ingestion layer, best practices include balancing latency versus\ncost by selecting appropriate services (e.g., Snowpipe, Snowpipe\nStreaming, or third-party tools) and choosing the right storage format\n(e.g., native tables, Iceberg). For transformations, design with\nfrequency versus SLA in mind to ensure data freshness matches the\nbusiness need. For analytics, apply schema design best practices such as\nthoughtful clustering key choices and pruning strategies to reduce\nconsumed credits. In distribution, optimize data transfer by monitoring\negress patterns and applying cost-saving practices like the [Snowflake Data Transfer Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) .\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models\nContent:\n**Storage:** Costs are based on the average monthly compressed data\nvolume stored, including active data, Time Travel (data retention),\nand Fail-safe (disaster recovery) data. The price per terabyte (TB)\nvaries by cloud provider and region. **Serverless features:** Snowflake Serverless features use resources\nmanaged by Snowflake, not the user, which automatically scale to meet\nthe needs of a workload. This allows Snowflake to pass on efficiencies\nand reduce platform administration while providing increased\nperformance to customers. The cost varies by feature and is outlined\nin Snowflake\u2019s Credit Consumption Document . **Cloud services layer:** This encompasses essential background\nservices, including query compilation, metadata management,\ninformation schema access, access controls, and authentication.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models\nContent:\nUsage\nfor cloud services is only charged if the daily consumption of cloud\nservices exceeds 10% of the daily usage of virtual warehouses. **AI features:** Snowflake additionally offers artificial intelligence\nfeatures that run on Snowflake-managed compute resources, including\nCortex AISQL functions (e.g. COMPLETE, CLASSIFY, etc. ), Cortex\nAnalyst, Cortex Search, Fine Tuning, and Document AI. The usage of\nthese features, often with tokens, are converted to credits to unify\nwith the rest of Snowflake\u2019s billing model. Details are listed in the\nCredit Consumption Document. **Data transfer:** Data transfer is the process of moving data into\n(ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Track usage data for all platform resources**\nTo deliver clear and actionable consumption insights, it is essential to\nleverage the rich usage data that Snowflake natively provides. The\nfoundation for all cost visibility is the **SNOWFLAKE** database, which\ncontains two key schemas for this purpose: [ACCOUNT_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) (for granular, account-level data) and [ORGANIZATION_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage) (for a consolidated view across all accounts).\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n| Metric Category | Description | Key Metrics | Primary Data Sources |\n| Compute & query metrics | Understand the cost of query execution, warehouse consumption, and overall compute health. These are often the most dynamic and largest portion of your spend. | - Credits used: total credits by warehouse |  |\n| - Query performance: execution time, bytes scanned, compilation time, parameterized query hash |  |  |  |\n| - Warehouse health: % idle time, queueing, spilling, concurrency | - `ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` (hourly warehouse credit usage) |  |  |\n| - `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` (detailed query metrics and associated warehouses) |  |  |  |\n| Serverless & AI metrics | Track credit consumption by Snowflake\u2011managed services and AI features. | - Credits used by service |  |\n| - Cost per credit\u2011consuming events | - `ACCOUNT_USAGE.<Serverless Feature>_HISTORY` |  |  |\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Snowsight's built-in cost management capabilities:** Snowsight\nprovides pre-built visuals for usage and credit monitoring directly\nwithin the [Snowflake Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) . It allows filtering by tags (e.g., view cost by department tag),\ncredit consumption by object types, and cost insights to optimize the\nplatform. **Creating custom dashboards or Streamlit apps for different stakeholder groups:** Snowsight facilitates the creation of custom\ndashboards using ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE views. Custom\ncharts in the Dashboards feature and Streamlit apps can both be easily\nshared. Combined with cost allocation and tagging, this allows for\ntailored views for finance managers (aggregated spend), engineering\nmanagers (warehouse utilization), or data analysts (query\nperformance).\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Integrating with third-party BI tools for advanced analytics:** Connecting to Snowflake from tools like Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or\ncustom applications offers highly customizable and extensive control\nover cost data visualization. Cloud-specific third-party data programs\n(FinOps platforms) offer easier setup and more out-of-the-box\nSnowflake cost optimization insights. **Leverage Cortex Code (In Preview):** This AI Assistant capability\nallows users to query cost and usage data in ACCOUNT_USAGE views using\nnatural language natively in the Snowsight UI.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources\nContent:\nFor serverless features, which do not use warehouse compute and\ntherefore cannot leverage the Resource Monitor feature, we recommend\nsetting up a budget. [Budgets](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) allow\nyou to define a monthly spending limit on the [compute costs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute) for a Snowflake account or a custom group of Snowflake objects. When the\nspending limit is projected to be hit, a notification is sent. While\nBudgets do not explicitly allow you to suspend serverless features upon\nreaching a limit (the way that Resource Monitors do), Budgets can be\nconfigured to not only send emails, but also send [notifications](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/notifications) to a cloud message queue or other webhooks (such as Microsoft Teams,\nSlack, or PagerDuty).\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Optimize > Overview > Leverage Managed Services\nContent:\nTo achieve significant operational efficiency and predictable costs,\nprioritize the use of serverless and managed services. These services\neliminate the need to manage underlying compute infrastructure, allowing\nyour organization to pay for results rather than resource provisioning\nand scaling. Evaluate the following servterless features to reduce costs\nand enhance performance in your environment.\n**Storage optimization**\nSnowflake offers several serverless features that automatically [manage and optimize your tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-storage) ,\nreducing the need for manual intervention while improving query\nperformance. The following features ensure your data is efficiently\norganized, allowing for faster and more cost-effective qeuerying without\nthe burden of user management.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Optimize > Overview > Limit data transfer\nContent:\nData egress, the transfer of data from one cloud provider or region to\nanother, can incur substantial costs, particularly when handling large\ndata volumes. Implementing appropriate tools and best practices is\nessential to minimize these data transfer expenses and maximize business\nvalue when data egress is necessary.\n**Tooling: Enable proactive cost management**\nLeverage Snowflake's native features to gain visibility and control over\ndata transfer costs before they become a significant expense.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Optimize > Overview > Workload optimization\nContent:\nInefficient queries often lead to excessive and hidden credit\nconsumption. Organizations can identify performance bottlenecks and\nunderstand the cost impact of specific SQL patterns by using Snowflake\nfeatures and adhering to SQL code best practices. This enables\ndevelopment teams to create more efficient and cost-effective code by\nhighlighting poor performing queries. Refer to the Performance\nOptimization Pillar of the Snowflake Well-Architected Framework for\ndetails on how to do this.\n**Utilize query history & insights for highlevel monitoring**\nFor broader visibility across all workloads, the Snowsight UI and the\nACCOUNT_USAGE schema are indispensable.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Optimize > Overview > Improve continually\nContent:\nThis continual improvement framework is the culmination of all subtopics\nwithin the Cost Optimization Pillar and provides a consistent way for\nyou to grow healthily on Snowflake.\nUpdated Nov 24, 2025\nThis content is provided as is, and is not maintained on an ongoing basis.

You can ask questions via chat and have it generate a Next.js app that runs against your Snowflake data Compute stays in Snowflake, while Vercel handles the front-end. In short data engineers can now expose Snowflake data through AI-generated web apps without moving the data around. This puts Snowflake right into the modern app dev stack.\n[**Build and deploy data applications on Snowflake with v0 \u2013 Vercel**](https://vercel.com/blog/build-and-deploy-data-applications-on-snowflake-with-v0)\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake BUILD 2025: Quick recap of new features > Conclusion\nContent:\nAll told, Snowflake BUILD 2025 was loaded with updates for data engineers and developers. The platform is leaning heavily into making AI feel native (Cortex AI, AISQL, Snowflake Intelligence) and the data lakehouse more open and real-time (Openflow, Interactive Tables, Iceberg interoperability). At the same time, they also smoothed out the dev experience (Workspaces, Git, Snowpark Connect) while beefing up enterprise ops like FinOps controls, encryption, and backups. And that\u2019s just scratching the surface.\nRelated posts:"

      "excerpts": [
        "Section Title: Marketplace Monetization: Turn Your Data and Apps into a Revenue Stream\nContent:\nSnowflake Marketplace is a vibrant resource, with hundreds of providers offering thousands of ready-to-try or ready-to-buy third-party data sets, applications and services. Many of these providers make their products available on Snowflake Marketplace for Snowflake customers to purchase \u2014 and they use our integrated Marketplace Monetization capabilities to simplify the process and speed up procurement and sales cycles. Some even leverage Marketplace Monetization exclusively to avoid having to build, manage or maintain their own billing and payment infrastructure. Let\u2019s take a closer look at Snowflake\u2019s monetization options, how providers can maximize their listing flexibility, and why both providers and their customers benefit from simplifying access to the latest data, services and apps.\nSection Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nMarketplace Monetization allows providers to sell their products to Snowflake customers and invoice them directly through Snowflake. Because they\u2019re purchasing through an already-known vendor, customers can avoid the potentially lengthy process of vetting, onboarding and verifying security policies for a new vendor and start using the data products right away. Shortening the sales, procurement and contracting cycle translates into faster time to value \u2014 which is good news for both customers and providers. Customers can also easily pay their Snowflake Marketplace invoice via electronic fund transfer, credit card payment or even with their Snowflake capacity commitment (via Marketplace Capacity Drawdown for eligible customers). The customer\u2019s monetary payment is disbursed directly to the provider. Pricing is, of course, controlled and defined by the provider.\nSection Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nIt can be custom and privately available/visible for select customers, or be made more general for standardized products that are publicly available. Snowflake offers a multitude of monetization models from pay-as-you-go usage that is based on consumption to all-you-can-eat subscription-based models. No matter which model they use, providers can port their pricing and monetization strategy directly to Snowflake without worrying about pricing strategy mismatch across channels. (Please note: Snowflake currently only supports USD-based pricing for Marketplace Monetization.) Understandably, customers may hesitate to pay for a data product without a chance to \u201ckick the tires\u201d a bit and properly evaluate the solution. Snowflake Marketplace takes care of this with several options to allow customers to try out a listing before purchasing: * Time-limited trials\nSection Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nLimited functionality trials, analogous to the \u201cfreemium\u201d model common to SaaS products\nUsage-based trials (currently in private preview)\nMany successful providers publish public paid listings with free trials on Snowflake Marketplace to create awareness with new and existing customers. This strategy allows them to address the self-service customer segments while still generating leads for upselling and creating opportunities for private conversations about customized products. One of the most valuable features of Snowflake\u2019s monetization capabilities, in my opinion, is that Snowflake shares end-to-end analytics back to providers.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Snowflake Native App Framework Now Generally Available on AWS and Azure\nContent:\nUnmesh Jagtap | Phoebe He\nJan 31, 2024 | 5 min read\nProduct and Technology\nSection Title: ... > 3 Reasons to Try and Buy Snowflake Native Apps on Snowflake Marketplace\nContent:\nTravis Kaufman\nJul 10, 2023 | 5 min read\nApplications"

      "excerpts": [
        "Section Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake \u2014 Insights from a Streamlit App > Why FinOps Matters\nContent:\nMost cloud providers actively support FinOps practices through the [FinOps Foundation](http://www.finops.org) , helping customers optimize their cloud bills in line with open standards like FOCUS. The FOCUS specification is an open schema maintained by the Foundation where providers and vendors can map their cost and usage data to a consistent model. This makes it easier for enterprises to aggregate, analyze, and act on cost data across multi-cloud and SaaS ecosystems.\nSection Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake \u2014 Insights from a Streamlit App > Why FinOps Matters\nContent:\nIn the case of Snowflake, it provides native transparency through `ACCOUNT_USAGE` and `ORGANIZATION_USAGE` views, giving teams near real-time insights into where credits are being consumed\u2014whether in warehouses, queries, or storage. Its credit-based billing model is also directly recognized in the FOCUS specification, ensuring alignment with the industry\u2019s standard for cloud cost and usage data. You can see the details of the FOCUS v1.2 spec [here](https://focus.finops.org/focus-specification/v1-2/) .\n*Note: At the time of writing, FOCUS v2.1 is the latest version. Snowflake mappings are still primarily aligned with v1.2, which means some newer dimensions (e.g., richer invoice identifiers, commitments) require external enrichment pipelines.*\nSection Title: ... > How Snowflake Maps Its Cost Data Model to FOCUS v1.2\nContent:\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nFOCUS in Snowflake\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Why Build a Custom Cost Analytics App?\nContent:\nSnowflake\u2019s native portal and Snowsight dashboards provide useful insights into usage, spend, and warehouse performance \u2014 great for quick checks and financial reconciliation. But when teams need interactive, FinOps-oriented analysis, a custom Streamlit app inside Snowflake delivers more. By combining live telemetry ( `ACCOUNT_USAGE` ) with pre-aggregated snapshots, applying cost-aware caching, and drilling into query-level cost drivers, the app goes beyond static reporting. It enforces permission checks, adds filters by service or warehouse, and surfaces the underlying SQL so Finance and Engineering share the same transparent view. In short, it transforms Snowflake telemetry into a collaborative cockpit for FinOps, aligning data with FOCUS dimensions and enabling actionable insights, accountability, and optimization at scale.\n ... \nSection Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake \u2014 Insights from a Streamlit App > A Few Useful Query Patterns\nContent:\n```\n-- Daily credits used by warehouse  \nSELECT  \n  WAREHOUSE_NAME,  \n  TO_DATE(START_TIME)  AS  USAGE_DATE,  \n  ROUND( SUM (CREDITS_USED),  3 )  AS  WH_CREDITS  \nFROM  SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  \nWHERE  START_TIME  >= '2025-08-29' AND  START_TIME  < '2025-08-30'  \n--AND WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'MY_WH'  \nGROUP BY 1 , 2  \nORDER BY 2 , 1 ;\n```\n```\n-- Daily credits used across all warehouses  \nSELECT  TO_DATE(START_TIME)  AS  USAGE_DATE,  SUM (CREDITS_USED)  AS  DAILY_CREDITS  \nFROM  SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  \nWHERE  START_TIME  >= '2025-08-29' AND  START_TIME  < '2025-08-30'  \nGROUP BY  USAGE_DATE  \nORDER BY  USAGE_DATE;\n```"
