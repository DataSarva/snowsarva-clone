Always `0` when the SERVICE\\_TYPE is one of the Openflow types. |\n|CREDITS\\_USED |NUMBER |Total number of credits used for the account in the hour. This is a sum of CREDITS\\_USED\\_COMPUTE and CREDITS\\_USED\\_CLOUD\\_SERVICES. This value does not take into account the adjustment for cloud services, and may therefore be greater than your actual credit consumption. |\n|BYTES |NUMBER |When the service type is `auto_clustering` , indicates the number of bytes reclustered during the START\\_TIME and END\\_TIME window. When the service type is `pipe` , indicates the number of bytes inserted during the START\\_TIME and END\\_TIME window.

When the service type is `COPY_FILES` , columns are aggregated at the database level. |\n|ROWS |NUMBER |When the service type is `auto_clustering` , indicates number of rows reclustered during the START\\_TIME and END\\_TIME window. When the service type is `SNOWPIPE_STREAMING` , indicates the number of rows migrated during the START\\_TIME and END\\_TIME window. |\n|FILES |NUMBER |When the service type is `pipe` , indicates number of files loaded during the START\\_TIME and END\\_TIME window.
