The Native Application Framework takes connected applications to the next level by allowing providers to bring their application code to their customers’ data (see Figure 1).\nSection Title: ... > Bring Your Application to Your Customer’s Data\nContent:\nThe Native Application Framework makes it easy to build, sell, and deploy applications within the Data Cloud. You can build applications using Snowflake core functionalities such as UDFs and stored procedures, and even the Streamlit integration (currently in development), then sell them to customers across the Data Cloud via Snowflake Marketplace . The framework also provides telemetry tools to make it easy to monitor and support your applications. What’s really powerful is that native apps are deployed in the customer’s account in a way that gives the customer control over their data, while still protecting the provider’s intellectual property. The native application deployment model complements both connected and managed application deployment models, providing a new degree of flexibility when developing applications. These models are not mutually exclusive.\nSection Title: ... > Bring Your Application to Your Customer’s Data\nContent:\nWe expect that many developers will implement applications across multiple models, depending on their use case.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Provider Benefits: Build, Distribute, and Deploy in the Data Cloud\nContent:\nBy publishing their apps in Snowflake Marketplace, they join the Snowflake Marketplace Partner Program and enable thousands of Snowflake customers globally to easily discover, install, and pay for their applications. Finally, applications built on the Native Application Framework can be deployed faster and with improved margins. Because customers don’t need to move or share access to data, sales and deployment cycles are shorter, especially for customers who may be concerned about vendor risk or data exfiltration issues. Providers also simplify their operations by not having to manage sensitive data, since customers grant data access directly to the application without having to share it with the providers. And because applications use the compute in their customers’ accounts, application providers improve their margins by lowering their own compute costs.\nSection Title: ... > Customer Benefits: Put Your Data to Work, Faster and More Securely\nContent:\nNative applications are also a game changer for customers. They retain control of their data and can get more value from it. Customers can reduce data silos and improve data governance because data doesn’t need to be moved to or exposed to the app provider. They can control what an application can do in their accounts by granting granular permissions such as external access or log sharing to the application directly using role-based access controls (RBAC). With Snowflake Marketplace, customers can dramatically simplify and shorten application procurement cycles from months to just a few clicks. By discovering out-of-the-box applications in Snowflake Marketplace, customers can immediately put their data to work and get more value from it, compared to building applications themselves. It takes only a few clicks for customers to discover, buy, and use trusted applications, accelerating their time to value."]},{"url":"https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/snowflake-native-apps/","title":"Snowflake Native Apps 101: Build and monetize data apps (2026)","publish_date":"2026-01-27","excerpts":["Section Title: Snowflake Native Apps 101: Build and monetize data apps (2026) > ... > 8) **Streamlit Integration**\nContent:\nYou can integrate your apps with Streamlit , which allows you to create interactive dashboards within Snowflake.

For additional information, see Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions .\nThis topic describes how providers can develop a Snowflake Native App to create objects in the\nconsumer account or access existing objects.\nSection Title: ... > Overview of creating and accessing objects in a consumer account ¶\nContent:\nSnowflake Native Apps often need to create or access objects in a consumer account. For example,\neven a basic app that allows the consumer to query shared data would require the app\nto create and use a warehouse in the consumer account. An app may also need to connect to external\nservices that are outside Snowflake.\nThe Snowflake Native App Framework provides two ways of requesting privileges to create objects in the consumer account.\n ... \nSection Title: Create and access objects in a consumer account ¶ > Comparison of automatic and manual privileges ¶\nContent:\nConsumers must approve external access using app specifications. |Consumers must manually create the required network rules and external access integrations and\nbind the integration using references. |\n|Access external identity providers |Apps can create security integrations for external API Authentication.\nConsumers must approve the external connection using app specification. |Consumers must manually create the required security integrations and bind the integration\nwith references |\n|Access to existing objects |Providers must use references to access existing objects.\nConsumers approve access to the references. |Providers must use references to access existing objects.\nSection Title: Create and access objects in a consumer account ¶ > Comparison of automatic and manual privileges ¶\nContent:\nConsumers approve access to the references. |\n|App development |Providers do not have to write code to determine if the consumer has granted a certain privilege. |Providers must write code that checks if the consumer has granted a certain privilege. |\n|App installation |Consumers do not have to manually create objects or grant privileges. |Consumers must manually create objects in their account or explicitly grant privileges to the app\nusing Snowsight or SQL. |\nSection Title: ... > Security considerations when using auto privileges with app specifications ¶\nContent:\nApp specifications only control communications to endpoints outside\nSnowflake. Consumers can approve or decline app specifications to\nallow or prevent the app making connection to these endpoints.\nApp specifications do not prevent the app from creating\nSnowflake objects that control external connections: network rules,\nexternal access integrations, and security integrations. Privileges\nto create these objects are granted using automated granting of\nprivileges.\nApp specifications do not provide data validation. In addition,\nthey do not place any restrictions on secrets or tokens referenced\nby an external access integration or security integration.\nFor example, if a provider configures an external access integration\nof an app to use ALLOWED_AUTHENTICATION_SECRETS and the consumer\napproves the app specification for that integration, the app can later\nmodify the secrets and tokens that it uses."]},{"url":"https://medium.com/@DhamanS/building-a-snowflake-finops-dashboard-with-streamlit-cortex-ai-f05c921565b9","title":"Building a Snowflake FinOps Dashboard with Streamlit + Cortex AI | by Dhaman=DataShaman | Jan, 2026 | Medium","publish_date":"2026-01-19","excerpts":["Sitemap\n[Open in app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medium.reader&referrer=utm_source%3DmobileNavBar&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\nWrite\nSearch\nMember-only story\nSection Title: Building a Snowflake FinOps Dashboard with Streamlit + Cortex AI\nContent:\nDhaman=DataShaman\n5 min read\n·\nJan 19, 2026\n--\nShare\nSection Title: ... > A Deep, Production-Grade End-to-End Guide\nContent:\nSnowflake cost optimization is no longer optional.\nAs organizations scale analytics, machine learning, and data products, Snowflake becomes one of the largest — and least understood — line items in cloud spend.

Developers can then query Event Tables to troubleshoot their applications or gain insights into performance and code behavior.\nLogs and traces are collected and propagated via Snowflake’s telemetry APIs, then automatically ingested into your Snowflake Event Table.\nSection Title: ... > Simplify troubleshooting in Snowflake Native Apps\nContent:\nEvent Tables are also supported for Snowflake Native Apps. When a Snowflake Native App runs, it is running in the consumer’s account, generating telemetry data that’s ingested into their active Event Table.\nOnce the consumer enables event sharing, new telemetry data will be ingested into both the consumer and provider Event Tables. Now the provider has the ability to debug the application that’s running in the consumer’s account. The provider only sees the telemetry data that is being shared from this data application—nothing else.\nSection Title: ... > Improve reliability across a variety of use cases\nContent:\nYou can use Event Tables to capture and analyze logs for various use cases: * As a data engineer building UDFs and stored procedures within queries and tasks, you can instrument your code to analyze its behavior based on input data.\nAs a Snowpark developer, you can instrument logs and traces for your Snowflake applications to troubleshoot and improve their performance and reliability.\nAs a Snowflake Native App provider, you can analyze logs and traces from various consumers of your applications to troubleshoot and improve performance.\nSection Title: ... > Improve reliability across a variety of use cases\nContent:\nSnowflake customers ranging from Capital One to phData are already using Event Tables to unlock value in their organization. “The Event Tables feature simplifies capturing logs in the observability solution we built to monitor the quality and performance of Snowflake data pipelines in Capital One Slingshot,” says Yudhish Batra, Distinguished Engineer, Capital One Software. “Event Tables has abstracted the complexity associated with logging from our data pipelines—specifically, the central Event Table gives us the ability to monitor and alert from a single location.”\nAs phData migrates its Spark and Hadoop applications to Snowpark, the Event Tables feature has helped architects save time and hassle.\n“When working with Snowpark UDFs, some of the logic can become quite complex. In some instances, we had thousands of lines of Java code that needed to be monitored and debugged,” says Nick Pileggi,\nPrincipal Solutions Architect at phData\nSection Title: ... > Improve reliability across a variety of use cases\nContent:\n. “Before Event Tables, we had almost no way to see what was happening inside the UDF and correct issues. Once we rolled out Event Tables, the amount of time we spent testing dropped significantly and allowed us to have debug and info-level access to the logs we were generating in Java.”\nOne large communications service provider also uses logs in Event Tables to capture and analyze failed records during data ingestion from various external services to Snowflake. And a Snowflake Native App provider offering geolocation data services uses Event Tables to capture logs and traces from their UDFs to improve application reliability and performance.\nWith Event Tables, you now have a built-in place to easily and consistently manage logging and tracing for your Snowflake applications. And in conjunction with other features such as Snowflake Alerts and Email Notifications, you can be notified of new events and errors in your applications."]}],"usage":[{"name":"sku_search","count":1}]}
