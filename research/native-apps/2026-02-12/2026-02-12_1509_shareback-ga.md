# Research: Native Apps - 2026-02-12

**Time:** 15:09 UTC  
**Topic:** Snowflake Native App Framework  
**Researcher:** Snow (AI Assistant)

## Accurate Takeaways

1. Snowflake Native Apps now support **“shareback”**: providers can **request permission from consumers** to share data back to the provider (or to designated third parties) via a governed mechanism.
2. Snowflake positions shareback as enabling **compliance reporting**, **telemetry/analytics sharing**, and **data preprocessing** scenarios.
3. The shareback capability is **General Availability** as of **Feb 10, 2026**.

## Snowflake Objects & Data Sources

| Object/View | Type | Source | Notes |
|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| *(TBD — depends on implementation details of app specifications and data sharing objects)* | | | Need to read the “Request data sharing with app specifications” guide and identify which objects are created/managed (shares, listings, application packages, etc.). |

## MVP Features Unlocked

1. **Telemetry / Usage feedback loop for FinOps app**: add an *opt-in* shareback flow so consumers can grant permission for the app to periodically share aggregated cost/usage telemetry back to the provider for benchmarking and product improvement.
2. **Compliance evidence export**: support an opt-in shareback mechanism to deliver attestation/compliance outputs (e.g., cost policy compliance summaries) back to provider/3rd-party auditor.
3. **Provider-assisted optimization**: allow consumers to share curated “optimization inputs” (warehouse configs, query patterns, budgets) to a provider-operated service for generating recommended settings or rulesets.

## Concrete Artifacts

### Sketch: shareback consent + data minimization checklist

- Ask for **minimum required** dataset(s) and retention period.
- Provide consumer-visible docs: what is shared, how often, and how it’s aggregated.
- Include a consumer-side “disable shareback” control in UI + revoke path.

## Risks / Assumptions

| Risk/Assumption | Impact | Validation |
|-----------------|--------|------------|
| Shareback mechanics (exact objects, privileges, review flows) may be more complex than implied by the release note. | Could increase implementation effort and time-to-ship. | Read and prototype the referenced documentation; map required roles/privileges end-to-end. |
| Customer sensitivity around telemetry sharing. | Adoption risk if not clearly opt-in + minimized. | Provide explicit opt-in, minimal data, clear documentation, and a revoke path. |

## Next Steps / Follow-ups

- Read the app-specs/shareback guide in full and extract the exact object model (shares/listings/privileges).
- Convert the “Telemetry feedback loop” idea into an ADR + minimal schema + consumer consent UX.
