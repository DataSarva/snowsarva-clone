## Accurate Takeaways

*Plain statements validated from sources. No marketing language.*

1. Snowflake Native Apps “Shareback” is now **generally available** (release note dated Feb 10, 2026). 
2. Shareback lets an app **request permission from the consumer** to share data back to the provider and/or designated third-party Snowflake accounts via a **listing-based workflow**.
3. Implementing shareback uses **shares + external listings + LISTING-type app specifications**; consumers approve target accounts and (optionally) an auto-fulfillment refresh schedule.
4. LISTING app specifications require `manifest_version: 2` and the `CREATE SHARE` + `CREATE LISTING` privileges.
5. The app can use lifecycle callbacks (e.g., `specification_action`) to react when a consumer **APPROVES/DECLINES** the shareback request.

## Snowflake Objects & Data Sources

| Object/View | Type | Source | Notes |
|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| `CREATE SHARE` / `ALTER SHARE` | SQL object | Docs | App creates a share to expose app-owned objects. |
| `CREATE EXTERNAL LISTING` | SQL object | Docs | Listing is attached to the share; must be created unpublished (`PUBLISH=FALSE`, `REVIEW=FALSE`). |
| `ALTER APPLICATION SET SPECIFICATION ... TYPE = LISTING` | SQL object | Docs | Creates a LISTING app spec that requests permission for target accounts. |
| `SHOW APPROVED SPECIFICATIONS IN APPLICATION` | Command output | Docs | Can be used to validate consumer approval status. |
| `DESC LISTING <name>` | Command output | Docs | Validate listing configuration after approval. |
| `SHOW LISTINGS` / `DESC LISTINGS` | Command output | Docs | Used to locate `uniform_listing_locator` and query data via `NATIVEAPP$...` naming. |

**Legend:**
- `ACCOUNT_USAGE` = Account-level metadata
- `ORG_USAGE` = Organization-level
- `INFO_SCHEMA` = Database-level

## MVP Features Unlocked

*PR-sized ideas that can be shipped based on these findings.*

1. **Opt-in telemetry shareback for FinOps signals:** add a LISTING app spec that (when approved) shares a small schema of aggregated usage/cost signals back to the provider account for global benchmarking + product iteration.
2. **“Support bundle” shareback:** on-demand diagnostics tables (query history summaries, warehouse config snapshots, feature flags) shared to a provider support account only after consumer approval.
3. **Compliance export shareback:** optional shareback of governance/compliance artifacts (e.g., policy inventory snapshots) to a designated auditor account using `TARGET_ACCOUNTS`.

## Concrete Artifacts

### Minimal SQL skeleton for shareback

```sql
-- In setup script (after manifest requests CREATE SHARE + CREATE LISTING)
CREATE SHARE IF NOT EXISTS app_shareback_share;

-- Grant only app-owned objects
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE app_created_db TO SHARE app_shareback_share;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app_created_db.telemetry TO SHARE app_shareback_share;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE app_created_db.telemetry.daily_usage TO SHARE app_shareback_share;

CREATE EXTERNAL LISTING IF NOT EXISTS app_shareback_listing
  SHARE app_shareback_share
AS $$
title: "Optional telemetry share"
subtitle: "Aggregated usage metrics"
description: "If you approve, this shares aggregated app telemetry back to the provider"
listing_terms:
  type: "OFFLINE"
$$
PUBLISH = FALSE
REVIEW = FALSE;

ALTER APPLICATION SET SPECIFICATION shareback_spec
  TYPE = LISTING
  LABEL = 'Telemetry shareback'
  DESCRIPTION = 'Optional: share aggregated telemetry with provider'
  TARGET_ACCOUNTS = 'ProviderOrg.ProviderAccount'
  LISTING = app_shareback_listing;

-- Post-approval validation
SHOW APPROVED SPECIFICATIONS IN APPLICATION;
DESC LISTING app_shareback_listing;
```

## Risks / Assumptions

| Risk/Assumption | Impact | Validation |
|-----------------|--------|------------|
| Consumers can modify shares created by the application. | Provider may receive unexpected/incorrect datasets or schema changes. | Add integrity checks; document expectations; validate shared schema post-approval. |
| No built-in auditing for data shared back to provider. | Harder to satisfy strict compliance/audit-trail requirements. | Implement app-side logging + customer guidance; clarify in docs/ToS. |
| Cross-region auto-fulfillment refresh schedule costs are billed to consumer, but provider chooses schedule. | Provider could accidentally impose unnecessary cost. | Default to conservative refresh; make schedule configurable; explain cost tradeoffs. |
| Only app-created databases can be shared by the app. | Limits what can be shared back (can’t directly share arbitrary consumer data). | Ensure app writes shareback datasets into app-owned DB/tables. |

## Next Steps / Follow-ups

- Decide a minimal **shareback dataset** for Mission Control (telemetry schema + retention + anonymization rules).
- Add an MVP “Share telemetry back to provider” toggle in the app UI and wire it to creation/update of the LISTING app spec.
- Draft customer-facing copy explaining what’s shared, why, and cost implications (auto-fulfillment schedule).
