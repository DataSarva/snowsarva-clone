## Accurate Takeaways

*Plain statements validated from sources. No marketing language.*

1. **Native Apps “Application configuration” (Preview)** lets providers define configuration keys that the *consumer* fills in (e.g., external URLs, account identifiers, other app names). Configuration values can be marked **sensitive** to reduce exposure (e.g., in query history / command output).\
   Source: Snowflake release note (Feb 20, 2026) + linked docs.
2. **Native Apps “Inter-App Communication” (Preview)** enables secure communication between multiple Native Apps **within the same consumer account**, enabling sharing/merging of data across apps.\
   Source: Snowflake release note (Feb 13, 2026) + linked docs.
3. **Native Apps “Shareback” is GA**: an app can request permission from consumers to share data back to the provider (or a designated third party), supporting scenarios like telemetry/analytics sharing and compliance reporting.\
   Source: Snowflake release note (Feb 10, 2026) + linked docs.
4. **Sharing Streamlit in Snowflake apps (Preview)**: Streamlit apps can be shared via app-builder/app-viewer URLs, and access can be restricted so users can access only Streamlit apps (not other Snowflake surfaces).\

## Snowflake Objects & Data Sources

| Object/View | Type | Source | Notes |
|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| (TBD) | (TBD) | Docs | These release notes describe framework capabilities (config / IAC / shareback / Streamlit sharing). Specific metadata views and object names appear in the linked feature documentation; capture them when implementing. |

**Legend:**
- `ACCOUNT_USAGE` = Account-level metadata
- `ORG_USAGE` = Organization-level
- `INFO_SCHEMA` = Database-level

## MVP Features Unlocked

*PR-sized ideas that can be shipped based on these findings.*

1. **Consumer-supplied config with secret handling:** add an “App Setup” screen + backend that requests configuration keys for:
   - optional webhook/notification URL(s) (non-secret)
   - optional cost governance integration identifiers (non-secret)
   - optional API keys/tokens (marked **sensitive**) for integrations we can’t fully run inside Snowflake
2. **Telemetry/diagnostics shareback (now GA):** ship a provider-facing “fleet health” feed powered by consumer opt-in shareback (e.g., app version, feature flags, job success/failure counts). Keep the payload minimal and governed.
3. **Inter-app integration pattern (Preview):** design an integration interface so our FinOps app can exchange data with a companion “governance” or “observability” app in the same account (e.g., share computed cost anomalies into another app’s UX).
4. **Streamlit distribution strategy (Preview):** if we ship Streamlit components, evaluate app-viewer URLs + restricted access mode as a lightweight “read-only ops console” option for consumers.

## Concrete Artifacts

### Implementation sketch: “App configuration” usage

- Define a small schema of configuration keys (strings + descriptions + sensitivity).
- Validate required keys on install/upgrade.
- Store only references/hashed metadata where possible; rely on Snowflake’s sensitive configuration handling for secrets.

*(Exact DDL / object names depend on the feature docs linked below; capture in a follow-up when we implement.)*

## Risks / Assumptions

| Risk/Assumption | Impact | Validation |
|-----------------|--------|------------|
| Inter-App Communication is **Preview** | APIs/semantics may change; avoid hard dependencies | Read the linked “Inter-app Communication” docs and confirm current constraints + required privileges. |
| “Sensitive” configurations reduce exposure but aren’t necessarily equivalent to full secret-management guarantees | Potential data leakage if misused | Confirm behavior in docs (query history, SHOW output, logs) and test in a sandbox account. |
| Streamlit sharing in-app is **Preview** | UX/distribution changes possible | Validate in docs and check Snowsight/Streamlit behavior in a test org. |

## Next Steps / Follow-ups

- Pull the linked docs pages and extract:
  - exact SQL / object types involved (spec files, commands)
  - current limitations (roles, cross-account behavior, logging)
- Decide which of (a) shareback telemetry, (b) consumer config keys, (c) Streamlit distribution we want in the next milestone.
