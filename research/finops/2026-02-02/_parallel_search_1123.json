For transformations, design with\nfrequency versus SLA in mind to ensure data freshness matches the\nbusiness need. For analytics, apply schema design best practices such as\nthoughtful clustering key choices and pruning strategies to reduce\nconsumed credits. In distribution, optimize data transfer by monitoring\negress patterns and applying cost-saving practices like the [Snowflake Data Transfer Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) .\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Track usage data for all platform resources**\nTo deliver clear and actionable consumption insights, it is essential to\nleverage the rich usage data that Snowflake natively provides. The\nfoundation for all cost visibility is the **SNOWFLAKE** database, which\ncontains two key schemas for this purpose: [ACCOUNT_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) (for granular, account-level data) and [ORGANIZATION_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage) (for a consolidated view across all accounts).\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Snowsight's built-in cost management capabilities:** Snowsight\nprovides pre-built visuals for usage and credit monitoring directly\nwithin the [Snowflake Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) . It allows filtering by tags (e.g., view cost by department tag),\ncredit consumption by object types, and cost insights to optimize the\nplatform. **Creating custom dashboards or Streamlit apps for different stakeholder groups:** Snowsight facilitates the creation of custom\ndashboards using ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE views. Custom\ncharts in the Dashboards feature and Streamlit apps can both be easily\nshared. Combined with cost allocation and tagging, this allows for\ntailored views for finance managers (aggregated spend), engineering\nmanagers (warehouse utilization), or data analysts (query\nperformance).\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Integrating with third-party BI tools for advanced analytics:** Connecting to Snowflake from tools like Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or\ncustom applications offers highly customizable and extensive control\nover cost data visualization. Cloud-specific third-party data programs\n(FinOps platforms) offer easier setup and more out-of-the-box\nSnowflake cost optimization insights. **Leverage Cortex Code (In Preview):** This AI Assistant capability\nallows users to query cost and usage data in ACCOUNT_USAGE views using\nnatural language natively in the Snowsight UI.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Optimize > Overview > Limit data transfer\nContent:\nData egress, the transfer of data from one cloud provider or region to\nanother, can incur substantial costs, particularly when handling large\ndata volumes. Implementing appropriate tools and best practices is\nessential to minimize these data transfer expenses and maximize business\nvalue when data egress is necessary.\n**Tooling: Enable proactive cost management**\nLeverage Snowflake's native features to gain visibility and control over\ndata transfer costs before they become a significant expense."]},{"url":"https://www.unraveldata.com/insights/snowflake-cost-management/","title":"What are best practices for Snowflake cost management? | Unravel Data","publish_date":"2025-08-14","excerpts":["Unravel launches free Snowflake native app [Read press release](/resources/unravel-data-launches-free-snowflake-native-app/)\n[](#) [](/)\n ... \nSection Title: What are best practices for Snowflake cost management?\nContent:\nImplement automated resource scaling, set up granular monitoring, and establish clear governance policies to control spending while maintaining performance Managing costs in Snowflake isn’t just about turning off warehouses when you’re done.
