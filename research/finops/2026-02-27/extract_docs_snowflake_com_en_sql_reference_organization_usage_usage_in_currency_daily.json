        "Reference General reference SNOWFLAKE database Organization Usage USAGE\\_IN\\_CURRENCY\\_DAILY\n\nSchema:\n    ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE\n\n# USAGE\\_IN\\_CURRENCY\\_DAILY view \u00b6\n\nThe USAGE\\_IN\\_CURRENCY\\_DAILY view in the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema can be used to return the daily credit usage and usage in currency for\nan organization.\n\n## Columns \u00b6\n\n|Column Name |Data Type |Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|ORGANIZATION\\_NAME |VARCHAR |Name of the organization. |\n|CONTRACT\\_NUMBER |VARCHAR |Snowflake contract number for the organization. |\n|ACCOUNT\\_NAME |VARCHAR |Name of the account where the usage was consumed. |\n|ACCOUNT\\_LOCATOR |VARCHAR |Locator for the account where the usage was consumed. |\n|REGION |VARCHAR |Name of the region where the account is located. |\n|SERVICE\\_LEVEL |VARCHAR |Service level (edition) of the Snowflake account (Standard, Enterprise, Business Critical, etc.). |\n|USAGE\\_DATE |DATE |Date (in UTC format) in which the usage took place. |\n|USAGE\\_TYPE |VARCHAR |Corresponds to the Usage Category column in a billing statement, which exists for backward compatibility only. Use the BILLING\\_TYPE, RATING\\_TYPE, SERVICE\\_TYPE, and IS\\_ADJUSTMENT columns for billing reconciliation. |\n|USAGE |NUMBER (38,3) |Total amount of usage charged based on SERVICE\\_TYPE. The unit of the USAGE depends on the RATING\\_TYPE. For example, when the RATING\\_TYPE is `compute` , USAGE is measured in credits. When the RATING\\_TYPE is `data transfer` or `storage` , the usage is rated in terabytes. |\n|CURRENCY |VARCHAR |Currency of the usage. |\n|USAGE\\_IN\\_CURRENCY |NUMBER (38,2) |Total amount charged for the USAGE\\_TYPE for USAGE on the USAGE\\_DATE. |\n|BALANCE\\_SOURCE |VARCHAR |Source of the funds used to pay for the daily usage. The source can be one of the following:\n\n* `capacity` \u2014 Usage paid with credits remaining on an organization\u2019s capacity commitment.\n* `rollover` \u2014 Usage paid with rollover credits. When an organization renews a capacity commitment, unused credits are added to the\n  balance of the new contract as rollover credits.\n* `free usage` \u2014 Usage covered by the free credits provided to the organization.\n* `overage` \u2014 Usage that was paid at on-demand pricing, which occurs when an organization has exhausted its capacity, rollover,\n  and free credits.\n* `rebate` \u2014 Usage covered by the credits awarded to the organization when it shared data with another organization. |\n|BILLING\\_TYPE |VARCHAR |Indicates what is being charged or credited. Possible billing types include:\n\n* `consumption` \u2014 Usage associated with compute credits, storage costs, and data transfer costs.\n* `rebate` \u2014 Usage covered by the credits awarded to the organization when it shared data with another organization.\n* `priority support` \u2014 Charges for priority support services. This charge is associated with a stipulation in a contract, not with an account.\n* `vps_deployment_fee` \u2014 Charges for a Virtual Private Snowflake deployment.\n* `support_credit` \u2014 Snowflake Support credited the account to reverse charges attributed to an issue in Snowflake. |\n|RATING\\_TYPE |VARCHAR |Indicates how the usage in the record is rated, or priced. Possible values include:\n\n* `compute`\n* `data_transfer`\n* `storage`\n* `other` |\n|SERVICE\\_TYPE |VARCHAR |Type of usage. The following list includes many, but not all, of the possible service types:\n\n* `ARCHIVE_STORAGE_RETRIEVAL_FILE_PROCESSING` \u2014 See Billing for storage lifecycle policies .\n* `ARCHIVE_STORAGE_WRITE` \u2014 See Billing for storage lifecycle policies .\n* `AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING` \u2014 See Automatic Clustering .\n* `CLOUD_SERVICES` \u2014 See Cloud service credit usage .\n* `COPY_FILES` \u2014 See COPY FILES .\n* `DATA_TRANSFER` \u2014 See Understanding data transfer cost .\n* `EGRESS_COST_OPTIMIZER` \u2014 See Optimizing data transfer costs with Egress Cost Optimizer .\n* `INTERNAL_DATA_TRANSFER` \u2014 See costs associated with Snowpark Container Services .\n* `LOGGING` \u2014 See Logging, tracing, and metrics .\n* `MATERIALIZED_VIEW` \u2014 See Working with Materialized Views .\n* `OUTBOUND_PRIVATELINK_DATA_PROCESSED` \u2014 See Private connectivity for outbound network traffic .\n* `OUTBOUND_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS` \u2014 See Private connectivity for outbound network traffic .\n* `REPLICATION` \u2014 See Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts .\n* `QUERY_ACCELERATION` \u2014 See Using the Query Acceleration Service (QAS)\n* `SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION` \u2014 See Search optimization service\n* `SENSITIVE_DATA_CLASSIFICATION` \u2014 See Introduction to sensitive data classification .\n* `SERVERLESS_ALERTS` \u2014 See Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake .\n* `SERVERLESS_TASK` \u2014 See Introduction to tasks .\n* `SNOWPIPE` \u2014 See Snowpipe .\n* `SNOWPIPE_STREAMING` \u2014 See Snowpipe Streaming .\n* `STORAGE` \u2014 See Understanding storage cost .\n* `STORAGE_LIFECYCLE_POLICY_EXECUTION` \u2014 See Billing for storage lifecycle policies .\n* `TRUST_CENTER` \u2014 See Trust Center .\n* `WAREHOUSE_METERING` \u2014 See Virtual warehouse credit usage .
