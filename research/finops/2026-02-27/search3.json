Use the BILLING\\_TYPE, RATING\\_TYPE, SERVICE\\_TYPE, and IS\\_ADJUSTMENT columns for billing reconciliation. |\n|USAGE |NUMBER (38,3) |Total amount of usage charged based on SERVICE\\_TYPE. The unit of the USAGE depends on the RATING\\_TYPE. For example, when the RATING\\_TYPE is `compute` , USAGE is measured in credits. When the RATING\\_TYPE is `data transfer` or `storage` , the usage is rated in terabytes. |\n|CURRENCY |VARCHAR |Currency of the usage. |\n|USAGE\\_IN\\_CURRENCY |NUMBER (38,2) |Total amount charged for the USAGE\\_TYPE for USAGE on the USAGE\\_DATE. |\n|BALANCE\\_SOURCE |VARCHAR |Source of the funds used to pay for the daily usage. The source can be one of the following:\n\n* `capacity` \u2014 Usage paid with credits remaining on an organization\u2019s capacity commitment.\n* `rollover` \u2014 Usage paid with rollover credits. When an organization renews a capacity commitment, unused credits are added to the\n  balance of the new contract as rollover credits.\n* `free usage` \u2014 Usage covered by the free credits provided to the organization.\n* `overage` \u2014 Usage that was paid at on-demand pricing, which occurs when an organization has exhausted its capacity, rollover,\n  and free credits.\n* `rebate` \u2014 Usage covered by the credits awarded to the organization when it shared data with another organization. |\n|BILLING\\_TYPE |VARCHAR |Indicates what is being charged or credited. Possible billing types include:\n\n* `consumption` \u2014 Usage associated with compute credits, storage costs, and data transfer costs.\n* `rebate` \u2014 Usage covered by the credits awarded to the organization when it shared data with another organization.\n* `priority support` \u2014 Charges for priority support services. This charge is associated with a stipulation in a contract, not with an account.\n* `vps_deployment_fee` \u2014 Charges for a Virtual Private Snowflake deployment.\n* `support_credit` \u2014 Snowflake Support credited the account to reverse charges attributed to an issue in Snowflake. |\n|RATING\\_TYPE |VARCHAR |Indicates how the usage in the record is rated, or priced. Possible values include:\n\n* `compute`\n* `data_transfer`\n* `storage`\n* `other` |\n|SERVICE\\_TYPE |VARCHAR |Type of usage.

Customers who signed a contract through a Snowflake reseller cannot access data in these views.</sub>\n\n## Accessing the ORGANIZATION\\_ USAGE schema \u00b6\n\nThe ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema is available in the organization account and a regular account that has the ORGADMIN role enabled. How you access the views in the schema differs depending on which type of account you are using. For details about accessing views, see the following:\n\n* Access schema in the organization account\n* Access schema in an ORGADMIN-enabled account\n\nNote\n\nThe views in the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema are currently not available in US SnowGov Regions on AWS GovCloud and Microsoft Azure Government.\n\n### Access schema in the organization account \u00b6\n\nBy default, only users granted the GLOBALORGADMIN role can access ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE views in the organization account .\n\nTo grant access to other users, the organization administrator can grant the appropriate _application role_ to an account role or user.\n\nUsers who have been granted the SNOWFLAKE.ORG\\_USAGE\\_ADMIN application role can access all views in the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema of the\norganization account. The following example lets user `joe` access all views in the schema:\n\n```\nUSE ROLE GLOBALORGADMIN ; \n\n GRANT APPLICATION ROLE SNOWFLAKE . ORG_USAGE_ADMIN TO ROLE custom_role ; \n\n GRANT ROLE custom_role TO USER joe ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThe organization administrator can also grant access on a more granular level. For example, the ORGANIZATION\\_OBJECT\\_VIEWER application role\ngrants access to the DATABASES view but does not grant access to the TASK\\_HISTORY view.\n\nUse the following list to determine which application role grants access to a specific view. These application roles are in the SNOWFLAKE\napplication. Use the fully qualified name of the application role when granting it to another role (for example,\nSNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE\\_VIEWER).\n\n|View |Required application role |\n| --- | ---

ORGADMIN role enabled. Within a ORGADMIN-enabled account, anyone who has\naccess to the shared SNOWFLAKE database has access to the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema. By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role has privileges\nto this database, which means the ORGADMIN role does not have the necessary privileges. To grant these privileges to the ORGADMIN role, see Enabling other roles to use schemas in the SNOWFLAKE database .\n\nTo grant access to non-administrators, the organization administrator can grant the appropriate _database role_ to an account role or user.\n\nUsing the following list to determine which database role grants access to specific views.\n\nThe ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE\\_VIEWER, ORGANIZATION\\_BILLING\\_VIEWER, and ORGANIZATION\\_ACCOUNTS\\_VIEWER SNOWFLAKE database roles are granted the SELECT privilege on Organization Usage views in the shared SNOWFLAKE database.\n\nFor more information, refer to GRANT DATABASE ROLE .\n\n## General usage notes \u00b6\n\nThe Snowflake-specific views are subject to change. Avoid selecting all columns from these views. Instead, select the columns that you want.\nFor example, if you want the `name` column, use `SELECT name` , rather than `SELECT *` .\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

Optionally, you can create a specific schema for the Vantage user. Vantage requires read-only access to the following tables:\n\n* [`SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/warehouse_metering_history.html)\n  \n    + Returns hourly credit usage for both Virtual Warehouse credit usage and Cloud Services credit usage per warehouse, for all warehouses in your account. Data is retained for one year.\n* [`SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history.html)\n  \n    + Query history with various dimensions, including total elapsed time, warehouse used, data bytes scanned, etc. Data is retained for one year.\n* [`SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage/usage_in_currency_daily.html)\n  \n    + Returns the daily credit usage and usage in currency format for an organization.\n\nAs a best practice, it is suggested you create a schema specifically for the `vantage` user. Note, however, that this is optional. See the steps below for details on how to create this schema.\n\n## \u200b\n\nConnect Your Snowflake Account\n\n### \u200b\n\nPrerequisites\n\n[Create a free Vantage account](https://console.vantage.sh/signup) , then follow the steps below to integrate Snowflake costs.\n\n### \u200b\n\nSnowflake IP Allowed List\n\nIf your Snowflake cluster uses an IP allow list for access control, you will need to add the following IPs to that allowed list:\n\nCopy\n\nAsk AI\n\n```\n54.87.66.45 3.95.43.133 54.162.3.72 44.199.143.63 3.218.103.23\n```\n\n### \u200b\n\nSnowflake Schema for Vantage\n\nAfter creating the below schema, you can add the required views to that schema and grant the `vantage` user access to the schema.\n\nThe below commands are based on the Snowflake [documentation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Solution-Grant-access-to-specific-views-in-SNOWFLAKE-ACCOUNT-USAGE-to-custom-roles) .\n\n1\n\nFrom the top navigation in Vantage, click **Settings** .\n\n2\n\nOn the left navigation, select **Integrations** and select **Snowflake** .\n\n3\n\nThe Snowflake integrations page is displayed. Ensure you are on the **Connect** tab.\n\n4\n\nCopy the code that\u2019s provided under **Create Vantage User and Role** to Snowflake. This SQL creates a user named `vantage` , a role named `vantage` , and a warehouse named `vantage` . It also grants the necessary permissions.\n\nVantage automatically generates an [RSA public key](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) for you to use when creating the Vantage user and role. You need to copy the code directly from the Vantage integration page to add the RSA key.\n\nSample of code. Copy directly from Vantage console to get RSA key.\n\nCopy\n\nAsk AI\n\n```\nUSE  role  accountadmin; CREATE  DATABASE  vantage ; CREATE  ROLE  vantage; CREATE  USER  vantage ; GRANT  ROLE  vantage  to  user vantage; GRANT  ROLE  vantage  to  role  accountadmin; CREATE  WAREHOUSE vantage; GRANT  ALL  ON  WAREHOUSE vantage  TO  ROLE  vantage; ALTER  USER  vantage  SET  DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = vantage, DEFAULT_ROLE = vantage; ALTER  USER  vantage  SET  password = '' ; ALTER  USER  vantage  SET  RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = '{YOUR_RSA_KEY_GENERATED_BY_VANTAGE}' ;\n```\n\n5\n\nCopy the next code block to set up the Vantage-specific schema to read billing and usage data from your account.\n\nCopy\n\nAsk AI\n\n```\nUSE  WAREHOUSE vantage; DROP  VIEW  IF  EXISTS  VANTAGE . PUBLIC .QUERY_HISTORY; CREATE  VIEW  VANTAGE . PUBLIC . QUERY_HISTORY  AS SELECT  QUERY_ID, QUERY_TEXT, WAREHOUSE_SIZE, QUERY_PARAMETERIZED_HASH, USER_NAME, WAREHOUSE_ID, WAREHOUSE_NAME, ROLE_NAME, TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME, END_TIME, QUERY_TAG FROM  SNOWFLAKE .

This status indicates that Vantage is actively importing your Snowflake cost data. It may take several hours to populate within Vantage depending on the query volume of your warehouse. See the Integration Status documentation for details on integration statuses.\n\nAs soon as costs are processed, they will be available on your All Resources Cost Report. If you decide to remove your Snowflake integration from Vantage, all costs associated with your Snowflake integration will be removed from the Vantage console.\n\n### \u200b\n\nNext Steps - Manage Workspace Access\n\nOnce the import is complete and the integration status changes to **Stable** , you can select which workspaces this integration is associated with. See the Workspaces documentation for information.\n\n## \u200b\n\nData Refresh\n\nSee the provider data refresh documentation for information on when data for each provider refreshes in Vantage.\n\n## \u200b\n\nTroubleshoot Snowflake Errors\n\nCommon integration errors are described below.\n\n### \u200b\n\nquery\\_history column count mismatch\n\nSnowflake occasionally makes changes to the queries/tables that get used for cost and usage attribution, causing the views in Vantage to then be based on an old query. You may see an error in the Vantage console, similar to the below error:\n\nCopy\n\nAsk AI\n\n```\nView definition for 'VANTAGE.PUBLIC.QUERY_HISTORY' declared 66 column(s), but view query produces 77 column(s).\n```\n\nTo fix the issue, replace the three `Vantage` views in Snowflake and ensure the `vantage` user is granted permission on those views.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve completed the below steps, contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to reimport your Snowflake data.\n\nCopy\n\nAsk AI\n\n```\nUSE  WAREHOUSE vantage; DROP  VIEW  IF  EXISTS  VANTAGE . PUBLIC .QUERY_HISTORY; CREATE  VIEW  VANTAGE . PUBLIC . QUERY_HISTORY  AS SELECT  QUERY_ID, QUERY_TEXT, WAREHOUSE_SIZE, QUERY_PARAMETERIZED_HASH, USER_NAME, WAREHOUSE_ID, WAREHOUSE_NAME, ROLE_NAME, TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME, END_TIME, QUERY_TAG FROM  SNOWFLAKE .

This can occur if:\n\n* The public key was manually modified in Snowflake\n* The integration was recreated in Vantage, generating a new public key\n* The public key was incorrectly copied during initial setup\n\nTo resolve this issue:\n\n1\n\nNavigate to your Snowflake integration in Vantage:\n\n* From the top navigation, click **Settings**\n* On the left navigation, select **Integrations** and select **Snowflake**\n* Click on your Snowflake connection to open the **Manage Connection** page\n\n2\n\nCopy the **Primary Public Key** from the Vantage console. This is the RSA public key that Vantage generated for your integration.\n\n3\n\nIn Snowflake, update the `vantage` user\u2019s RSA public key to match the one from Vantage:\n\nCopy\n\nAsk AI\n\n```\nUSE  role  accountadmin; ALTER  USER  vantage  SET  RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = '{YOUR_RSA_KEY_GENERATED_BY_VANTAGE}' ;\n```\n\nReplace `{YOUR_RSA_KEY_GENERATED_BY_VANTAGE}` with the exact public key copied from the Vantage console.\n\n4\n\nVerify the connection is working. The error should be resolved once the public keys match.\n\nThe public key must match exactly between Vantage and Snowflake. Ensure you copy the entire key from the Vantage console without any modifications or extra characters.\n\nIf you continue to encounter errors after following these steps, contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) for assistance.\n\n## \u200b\n\nSnowflake Reporting Dimensions\n\nOn Snowflake Cost Reports , you can filter across several dimensions:\n\n* Account (account name)\n* Category (e.g., Data Cloud Data Transfer)\n* Metadata (e.g., `environment is staging` )\n* Region (e.g., AWS Eu West 1)\n* Organization (organization name)\n* Service (e.g., Data Cloud)\n* Tags: Includes Virtual Tags created in Vantage for this provider. The following tags are also available for filtering and grouping:\n  \n    + `user` : The user who ran the query, allowing you to filter and group costs by user.\n    + `warehouse` : The warehouse name, allowing you to filter and group costs by warehouse.\n    + `role` : The role name when present in the source data, allowing you to filter and group costs by role.\n    + `query_tag` : The query tag when present in the source data, allowing you to filter and group costs by query tag. This can be a single value or a hash of key-value pairs.\n* Charge Type (e.g., Usage)\n\n## \u200b\n\nActive Resources\n\nSnowflake queries are synced as active resources and available in resource reports .\n\nPlanetScale Previous Snowflake Costs per Query Next\n\n\u2318I\n\n[Vantage home page](https://www.vantage.sh)\n\n[x](https://x.com/JoinVantage) [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vantage-sh) [slack](https://vantage.sh/slack) [github](https://github.com/vantage-sh) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Vantagesh)\n\nDocs\n\n[Introduction](https://docs.vantage.sh/) [Quickstart](https://docs.vantage.sh/getting_started) [Cost Reports](https://docs.vantage.sh/cost_reports) [Autopilot](https://docs.vantage.sh/autopilot) [Product Changelog](https://docs.vantage.sh/changelog) [Vantage University](https://docs.vantage.sh/vantage_university)\n\nCommunity\n\n[Slack](https://vantage.sh/slack) [Cloud Cost Handbook](https://handbook.vantage.sh/) [EC2Instances.info](https://instances.vantage.sh/) [cur.vantage.sh](https://cur.vantage.sh/) [focus.vantage.sh](https://focus.vantage.sh/)\n\nMore\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/vantage-sh) [Vantage Status](https://status.vantage.sh/)\n\nCompany\n\n[About](https://www.vantage.sh/about) [Privacy Policy](https://www.vantage.sh/privacy-policy) [Terms of Use](https://www.vantage.sh/website-terms-of-use) [Service Agreement](https://www.vantage.sh/service-agreement) [Sub-Processors](https://www.vantage.sh/subprocessors)\n\n[Powered by](https://www.mintlify.com?utm_campaign=poweredBy&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=vantage-39)"

        "[DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.snowflake.com)\n\n/\n\nGet started\n\nGuides\n\nDeveloper\n\nReference\n\nRelease notes\n\nTutorials\n\n[Status](https://status.snowflake.com)\n\nGuides Organizations & Accounts Introduction\n\n# Introduction to organizations \u00b6\n\nAn _organization_ is a first-class Snowflake object that links the accounts owned by your business entity. Organizations simplify account\nmanagement and billing, Replication and Failover/Failback , Snowflake Secure Data Sharing, and other\naccount administration tasks.\n\nThis feature allows organization administrators to view, create, and manage all of your accounts across different regions and cloud platforms.\n\n## Types of accounts \u00b6\n\nAn organization can consist of the following types of accounts:\n\n* Organization account: Special account used by organization administrators to manage multi-account organizations and to access usage data\n  from premium views in the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema. For more information, see Organization accounts .\n* Regular Snowflake account, including trial accounts .\n* Snowflake Open Catalog account: Special account used by service admins and catalog admins to manage catalogs defined in Snowflake Open\n  Catalog. For more information, see [Snowflake Open Catalog overview](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/opencatalog/overview) .\n\n## Benefits \u00b6\n\n* A central view of all accounts within your organization. For more information, refer to Viewing accounts in your organization .\n* Self-service account creation. For more information, refer to Creating an account .\n* Data availability and durability by leveraging data replication and failover. For more information, see Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts .\n* Seamless data sharing with Snowflake consumers across regions. For more information, see Share data securely across regions and cloud platforms .\n* Ability to monitor and understand usage across all accounts in the organization. For more information, see Organization Usage views.\n\n## Organization creation \u00b6\n\nSnowflake customers never directly create an organization. For users who sign-up for a Snowflake account using the self-service option,\nan organization is automatically created with a system-generated name when the account is created. For entities who work directly with\nSnowflake personnel to set up accounts, Snowflake creates the organization to which the accounts belong using a custom name. In either\ncase, users can create additional accounts that belong to the organization after it is created with the initial account.\n\n## Viewing the name of your organization and its accounts \u00b6\n\nIf you are the organization administrator , you can view the name of your organization and\nits accounts through the web interface or using SQL:\n\n> SQL :\n>     Execute a SHOW ACCOUNTS command.\n> Snowsight :\n>     In the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Accounts . The organization name is listed above the account names.\n> \n> \n\nUsers with any role can execute the CURRENT\\_ORGANIZATION\\_NAME function to return the organization of the current account.\n\nUsers with any role can also find the organization name and account name for a specific account that they have previously signed in to.\nSee Finding the organization and account name for an account .\n\n## Changing the name of your organization \u00b6\n\nIf you want to change the name of an organization, for example to change a system-generated name to a more user-friendly one,\ncontact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support) .\n\nWhen you contact Snowflake Support, you must decide whether users can temporarily access accounts in the\norganization using the original account URL . If you keep the original account URL, it is automatically dropped\nafter 90 days, at which time users must use the new account URL to access the account. If you want to drop the account URL before the 90 days\nexpire, see Deleting an organization URL .\n\n## Deleting an organization \u00b6\n\nTo delete your Snowflake organization:\n\n1. Delete all accounts in the organization , except the account being used for the\n   deletion.\n2. Contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support) to delete the last account and the organization.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

Yes, we are talking about Organization Usage schema which hold historical usage metadata of all provides data across all the accounts in your organization.\n\n**What is metadata?**\n\nMetadata is data that provides information about other data, but not the content of the data, such as the text of a message or the image itself.\n\nSnowflake capture all the Organizational metadata in Snowflake Database under Organization\\_Usage schema.\n\n**What does Organizational Usage Schema holds and how long?**\n\nAll the view in Organizational Usage schema under Snowflake database can be view using Accountadmin role by default. Accountadmin must grant this privilege to other roles using \u201cgrant imported privileges on database snowflake to role XXX\u201d\n\nAll views have latency of **2\u201324 hrs** which may be earlier in some instance and holds historical data for **1 year** .\n\nThe organization billing views do not display the actual, final amount because some adjustments are made at the end of the month.\n\nBelow are the view available under Organization Usage schema at the moment with chance to get few more in recent future.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n1. **CONTRACT\\_ITEM View**\n\nThis view contain only the active contract related information for an Organization.

For example if we have Azure as our Cloud service in Account 1, and we replicate the data into Account 2 which is on GCP or AWS in the same or different location we will incur some data transfer. This view holds all this information for calculating transfer charges on every billing cycle. Latency for the view may be up to **120 minutes (2 hours).**\n\nThis view holds information as below:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nSource: Snowflake\n\n**3\\.

        "[Home](https://nimbusintelligence.com/) \u00bb [Blogposts](https://nimbusintelligence.com/blogposts/) \u00bb How To Check Your Usage History in Snowflake\n\nOne of the biggest difference of Snowflake from the other types of cloud-based data warehousing is that Snowflake offers a pricing control, which allows companies to manage their usage and costs effectively. You can check your usage history in a very detailed way and adjust the limitation of usage in specific areas to be able to manage your Snowflake account better.\n\n**Important Note:** only ACCOUNT ADMIN role can see the usage detail of the account.\n\n### How to check your usage history in Snowflake\n\nThere are several options to make this control, the first one and the simplest one is\n\n##### to check it from snows\u0131ght\n\nadmin part inside Snowsight\n\n1. 2\\. Click on the Usage tab:\n\nusage part inside Admin\n\n3\\. Here, you can view your usage history, you can filter the time that you want to see for the specific period; for day, for months\u2026:\n\nfiltering the period of usage\n\n4\\. You can filter your usage history by specific resources, such as storage or compute, to get a more detailed view of your usage:\n\nusage type options\n\n**Example** of monitoring the compute usage of last 28 days:\n\ncompute usage\n\nAs you can see in compute usage option, Snowflake shows us the usage in the base of credits. This type is always going to be in credits when you want to see the usage for specific type; for the total usage display it uses a currency.\n\nIn the bottom right corner (when we choose a usage type) it displays us even the details of used credit. We can see from here in which operation we lost the most value and so on.\n\n**Reminder:** it is important to remember that the usage in Snowflake depends on the Snowflake Version that you have your account with. In these examples we have our Snowflake Account in _Business Critical_ version which is the one of the most expensive versions but it has some special features for it ( [you can check from the link](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions) ).\n\n### To Check Your Snowflake Usage History in Real-Time Using Snowflake API\u2019s\n\nSnowflake also provides a number of APIs and integration tools that allow customers to monitor their usage history in real-time. This can help customers identify potential issues before they become major problems. To view your Snowflake usage history in real-time using API\u2019s, first you should match your snowflake account with an python program. [To do so you can check here](https://nimbusintelligence.com/2023/03/using-snowflake-data-in-python/) .\n\nOnce you have that, you can use the Snowflake usage REST API to access usage information for specific accounts, warehouses, and users. In addition you can use Snowflake usage Python Connector as well to retrive information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, Snowflake\u2019s usage section helps you to track your Snowflake utilization in a detailed way and to identify areas where you might be overspending and helps you to make adjustments to optimize your usage and reduce costs. As a last reminder, your Snowflake usage is going to depend on various factors but one of them is your accounts _Snowflake Edition_ .\n\nSnowflake offers you some additional features to track automatically the usage and allows you to set some _maximum credit usage values_ for the condition that you want specifically; these feature is named _Resource Monitors_ .  \n  \nIn addition, Snowflake, even without your input, enhances data with its _auto-clustering_ feature and helps you to reduce your usage.\n\nTo have additional information you can see my blog [Snowflake\u2019s Pricing Control.](https://nimbusintelligence.com/2023/03/snowflakes-type-of-tables-and-views/)\n\n### Credits\n\n<https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage>\n\n<https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage>\n\n* [Can Hobek](https://nimbusintelligence.com/author/can-hobeknimbusintelligence-com/ \"Can Hobek\") : Author\n  \n  Hello, my name is Can H\u00f6bek.
