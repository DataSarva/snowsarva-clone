        "Reference General reference SNOWFLAKE database Account Usage WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY\n\nSchemas:\n    ACCOUNT\\_USAGE , READER\\_ACCOUNT\\_USAGE\n\n# WAREHOUSE\\_ METERING\\_ HISTORY view \u00b6\n\nThis Account Usage view can be used to return the hourly credit usage for a single warehouse (or all the warehouses in your account) within the last 365 days (1 year).\n\n## Columns \u00b6\n\n|Column Name |Data Type |Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|READER\\_ACCOUNT\\_NAME |VARCHAR |Name of the reader account where the warehouse usage took place. Column only included in view in READER\\_ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema. |\n|START\\_TIME |TIMESTAMP\\_LTZ |The date and beginning of the hour (in the local time zone) in which the warehouse usage took place. |\n|END\\_TIME |TIMESTAMP\\_LTZ |The date and end of the hour (in the local time zone) in which the warehouse usage took place. |\n|WAREHOUSE\\_ID |NUMBER |Internal/system-generated identifier for the warehouse. |\n|WAREHOUSE\\_NAME |VARCHAR |Name of the warehouse. |\n|CREDITS\\_USED |NUMBER |Total number of credits used for the warehouse in the hour. This is a sum of CREDITS\\_USED\\_COMPUTE and CREDITS\\_USED\\_CLOUD\\_SERVICES. This value does not take into account the adjustment for cloud services , and may therefore be greater than the credits that are billed. To determine how many credits were actually billed, run queries against the METERING\\_DAILY\\_HISTORY view . |\n|CREDITS\\_USED\\_COMPUTE |NUMBER |Number of credits used for the warehouse in the hour. |\n|CREDITS\\_USED\\_CLOUD\\_SERVICES |NUMBER |Number of credits used for cloud services in the hour. |\n|CREDITS\\_ATTRIBUTED\\_COMPUTE\\_QUERIES |NUMBER |Number of credits attributed to queries in the hour. . . Includes only the credit usage for query execution and doesn\u2019t include warehouse idle time usage. |\n\n## Usage notes \u00b6\n\n* In the ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema, latency for the view is up to 180 minutes (3 hours), except for the CREDITS\\_USED\\_CLOUD\\_SERVICES column. Latency for\n  CREDITS\\_USED\\_CLOUD\\_SERVICES is up to 6 hours.\n* In the READER\\_ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema, latency for the view is up to 24 hours.\n* Warehouse idle time is not included in the CREDITS\\_ATTRIBUTED\\_COMPUTE\\_QUERIES column.\n  \n  See Examples for a query that calculates the cost of idle time.\n\n* If you want to reconcile the data in this view with a corresponding view in the ORGANIZATION USAGE schema , you must first set the timezone of the session to UTC. Before querying the Account Usage view, execute:\n  \n  > ```\n  > ALTER SESSION SET TIMEZONE = UTC ;\n  > ```\n  > \n  > Copy\n  > \n  >\n\n## Examples \u00b6\n\nFor example, to determine the cost of idle time for each warehouse for the last 10 days, execute the following statement:\n\n```\nSELECT \n  ( SUM ( credits_used_compute ) - \n    SUM ( credits_attributed_compute_queries )) AS idle_cost , \n  warehouse_name \n FROM SNOWFLAKE . ACCOUNT_USAGE . WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY \n WHERE start_time >= DATEADD ( 'days' , - 10 , CURRENT_DATE ()) \n  AND end_time < CURRENT_DATE () \n GROUP BY warehouse_name ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.
