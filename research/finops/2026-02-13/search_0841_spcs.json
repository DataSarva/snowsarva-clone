It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Principles > Business impact: Align cost with business value\nContent:\nConnect cloud spending directly to business outcomes, ensuring that every dollar spent in the cloud contributes meaningfully to strategic objectives and demonstrable value. Embed cost considerations directly into platform planning and architecture considerations.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Recommendations\nContent:\nFurthermore, you should establish a regular cadence for refreshing\nthis measurement to ensure value realization is in line with\nexpectations and business goals. **Visibility**\n**Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models:** Review\nSnowflake\u2019s billing models to align technical and non-technical\nresources on financial drivers and consumption terminology. **Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy:** Implement robust and organizationally consistent tagging and\nlabeling strategies across all resources (storage objects,\nwarehouses, accounts, queries) to accurately allocate costs to\nspecific teams, products, or initiatives. **Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA:** Implement a feedback system to transparently show or charge back\ncloud costs to relevant business units or teams, increasing\naccountability.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Recommendations\nContent:\n**Govern resource creation and administration:** Establish clear\nguidelines and automated processes for provisioning and maintaining\nresources, ensuring that only necessary and appropriately sized\nresources are deployed (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies,\nresource monitors). **Optimize**\n**Compute workload-aligned provisioning:** Continuously monitor\nresource health metrics to resize and reconfigure to match actual\nworkload requirements. **Leverage managed services:** Prioritize fully managed Snowflake\nservices (e.g., Snowpipe, Auto-clustering, [Query Acceleration Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) )\nto offload operational overhead and often achieve better cost\nefficiency. **Data storage types & lifecycle management:** Utilize appropriate\nstorage types and implement appropriate storage configuration to\nright-size workloads to your storage footprint.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models\nContent:\nIt is essential to review Snowflake's billing models to align technical\nand non-technical resources on financial drivers and consumption\nterminology. Snowflake's elastic, credit-based consumption model charges\nseparately for compute (Virtual Warehouses, Compute Pools, etc),\nstorage, data transfer, and various serverless features (e.g., Snowpipe,\nAutomatic Clustering, Search Optimization, Replication/Failover, AI\nServices). Understanding the interplay of these billing types ensures\nyou can attribute costs associated with each category\u2019s unique usage\nparameters. High-level categories are below.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models\nContent:\n**Compute (Virtual Warehouses, Snowpark Container Services, Openflow):** This is often the most dynamic and largest portion of\nSnowflake spend. Virtual Warehouses are billed per-second after an\ninitial 60-second minimum when active, with credit consumption\ndirectly proportional to warehouse size (e.g., an \u201cX-Small\u201d Gen1\nwarehouse consumes one credit per hour, a 'Small' consumes two credits\nper hour, doubling with each size increase) while SPCS (via [compute pools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) )\nare billed for all uptime with a minimum of five minutes. [Openflow](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/cost) is billed per second of runtime with a 60-second minimum.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models\nContent:\n**Storage:** Costs are based on the average monthly compressed data\nvolume stored, including active data, Time Travel (data retention),\nand Fail-safe (disaster recovery) data. The price per terabyte (TB)\nvaries by cloud provider and region. **Serverless features:** Snowflake Serverless features use resources\nmanaged by Snowflake, not the user, which automatically scale to meet\nthe needs of a workload. This allows Snowflake to pass on efficiencies\nand reduce platform administration while providing increased\nperformance to customers. The cost varies by feature and is outlined\nin Snowflake\u2019s Credit Consumption Document . **Cloud services layer:** This encompasses essential background\nservices, including query compilation, metadata management,\ninformation schema access, access controls, and authentication.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models\nContent:\nUsage\nfor cloud services is only charged if the daily consumption of cloud\nservices exceeds 10% of the daily usage of virtual warehouses. **AI features:** Snowflake additionally offers artificial intelligence\nfeatures that run on Snowflake-managed compute resources, including\nCortex AISQL functions (e.g. COMPLETE, CLASSIFY, etc. ), Cortex\nAnalyst, Cortex Search, Fine Tuning, and Document AI. The usage of\nthese features, often with tokens, are converted to credits to unify\nwith the rest of Snowflake\u2019s billing model. Details are listed in the\nCredit Consumption Document. **Data transfer:** Data transfer is the process of moving data into\n(ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models\nContent:\nThis generally happens via\negress on cross-region [data replication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-cost) , [copying into/out of stage, function calls](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/cost-understanding-data-transfer) ,\nand cross/same region [SPCS data transfer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) . Depending on the cloud provider and the region used during data\ntransfer, charges vary. **Data sharing & rebates:** Snowflake offers an opt-out Data\nCollaboration rebate program that allows customers to offset credits\nby data consumed with shared outside organizations. This rebate is\nproportional to the consumption of your shared data by consumer\nSnowflake accounts.

        "[DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.snowflake.com)\n\n/\n\nGet started\n\nGuides\n\nDeveloper\n\nReference\n\nRelease notes\n\nTutorials\n\n[Status](https://status.snowflake.com)\n\nDeveloper Snowpark Container Services Snowpark Container Services Costs\n\n# Snowpark Container Services costs \u00b6\n\n Feature \u2014 Generally Available\n\nSnowpark Container Services is available to accounts in AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform commercial regions , with some exceptions. For more information, see Available regions and considerations .\n\nThe costs associated with using Snowpark Container Services can be categorized into storage cost, compute pool cost, and data\ntransfer cost.\n\n## Storage cost \u00b6\n\nWhen you use Snowpark Container Services, storage costs associated with Snowflake, including the cost of Snowflake stage usage\nor database table storage, apply. For more information, see Exploring storage cost . In addition, the\nfollowing cost considerations apply:\n\n* **Image repository storage cost:** The implementation of the image repository uses\n  a Snowflake stage. Therefore, the associated cost for using the Snowflake stage applies.\n* **Log storage cost:** When you store local container logs in event tables , event table storage\n  costs apply.\n* **Mounting volumes cost:**\n  \n    + When you mount a Snowflake stage as a volume, the cost of using the Snowflake stage applies.\n    + When you mount storage from the compute pool node as a volume, it appears as local storage in the container. But there is no\n        additional cost because the local storage cost is covered by the cost of the compute pool node.\n* **Block storage cost:** When you create a service that uses block storage , you are billed for block storage and snapshot storage. For more information about storage pricing, see the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) . The SPCS Block Storage Pricing table in this document provides the information.\n\n## Compute pool cost \u00b6\n\nA compute pool is a collection of one or more virtual machine (VM) nodes on which Snowflake\nruns your Snowpark Container Services jobs and services. The number and type (instance family) of the nodes in the compute pool\n(see CREATE COMPUTE POOL ) determine the credits it consumes and thus the cost you pay. For more information, see the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) .\n\nYou incur charges for a compute pool in the IDLE, ACTIVE, STOPPING, or RESIZING state, but not when it is in a STARTING or\nSUSPENDED state. To optimize compute pool expenses, you should leverage the AUTO\\_SUSPEND feature (see CREATE COMPUTE POOL).\n\nThe following views provide usage information:\n\n* **ACCOUNT\\_USAGE views**\n  \n  The following ACCOUNT\\_USAGE views contain Snowpark Container Services credit usage information:\n  \n    + The SNOWPARK\\_CONTAINER\\_SERVICES\\_HISTORY view offers\n        credit usage information (hourly consumption) exclusively for Snowpark Container Services.\n    + In the METERING\\_DAILY\\_HISTORY view , query for rows in which the `service_type` column contains the value `SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES` .\n    + In the METERING\\_HISTORY view , query for rows in which the `service_type` column contains the value `SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES` .\n* **ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE views**\n  \n    + In the METERING\\_DAILY\\_HISTORY view , use the `SERVICE_TYPE = SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES` query filter.\n\n## Data transfer cost \u00b6\n\nData transfer is the process of moving data into (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake. For more information, see Understanding data transfer cost . When you use Snowpark Container Services, the following additional cost\nconsiderations apply:\n\n* **Outbound data transfer:** Snowflake applies the same data transfer rate for outbound data transfers from services and jobs\n  to other cloud regions and to the internet, consistent with the rate for all Snowflake outbound data transfers. For more\n  information, see the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) (table 4a).\n  \n  You can query the DATA\\_TRANSFER\\_HISTORY ACCOUNT\\_USAGE view for\n  usage information. The `transfer_type` column identifies this cost as the `SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES` type.\n* **Internal data transfer:** This class of data transfer refers to data movements across compute entities within Snowflake, such as\n  between two compute pools or a compute pool and a warehouse, that resulted from executing a service function .\n  For more information, see the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) (tables 4(a) for AWS, 4(b) for Azure, and the column titled \u201cSPCS Data Transfer to Same Cloud Provider, Same Region\u201d).\n  \n  To view the costs associated with internal data transfer, you can do the following:\n  \n    + Query the INTERNAL\\_DATA\\_TRANSFER\\_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema.\n    + Query the DATA\\_TRANSFER\\_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema. The `transfer_type` column identifies this cost as the `INTERNAL` type.\n    + Query the DATA\\_TRANSFER\\_HISTORY view in the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema.\n        The `transfer_type` column identifies this cost as the `INTERNAL` type.\n    + Query the DATA\\_TRANSFER\\_DAILY\\_HISTORY view in the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema. The `service_type` column identifies this cost as the `INTERNAL_DATA_TRANSFER` type.\n    + Query the RATE\\_SHEET\\_DAILY view in the ORGANIZATION USAGE\n        schema. The `service_type` column identifies this cost as the `INTERNAL_DATA_TRANSFER` type.\n    + Query the USAGE\\_IN\\_CURRENCY\\_DAILY view in the ORGANIZATION USAGE\n        schema. The `service_type` column identifies this cost as the `INTERNAL_DATA_TRANSFER` type.\n\nNote\n\nData transfer costs are currently not billed for Snowflake accounts on Google Cloud.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

Here, you will learn how to set up Snowflake compute pools, push container images, define service specifications and deploy your first containerized workload.\nSection Title: ... > What is Snowpark Container Services?\nContent:\n*Snowpark Container Services (SPCS)* is a fully managed container service integrated into Snowflake. You push [Open Container Initiative-compliant images](https://opencontainers.org/) to your account\u2019s private Open Container Initiative (OCI) image registry, then run those images as long-running services, finite Snowflake job services, or callable Snowflake service functions on Snowflake-managed compute pools.\nSnowflake SPCS guarantees that data remains secure and generally does not leave Snowflake\u2019s governed environment unless explicitly configured by the user for external access; your containers have fast local access to tables, stages and even secrets via Snowflake\u2019s security integrations. You also benefit from Snowflake\u2019s native features, such as role-based access control (RBAC) , governance , monitoring and auto-scaling.\nSection Title: ... > What is Snowpark Container Services?\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services Overview (Source: [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) )\nAs of 2025, Snowpark Container Services is generally available across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform commercial regions, with some exceptions (e.g., not available in most government regions or the Google Cloud me-central2 region). It is unavailable for trial accounts except for running notebooks. Check out [Snowflake\u2019s documentation for the latest region availability](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) .\nAccording to [Snowflake\u2019s official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) :\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Cost Categories in Snowpark Container Services\nContent:\nSnowflake formally divides Snowpark Container Services costs into storage, compute and data transfer.\n**Storage costs** : This includes any Snowflake storage you use (tables or stages) plus optional block storage for volumes or snapshots.\n**Compute pool costs** : Snowpark Container Services runs your containers on compute pools \u2013 essentially clusters of VMs. You pay credits based on the number and size of those nodes. That rate depends on the instance \u201cfamily\u201d you choose (CPU vs high-memory vs GPU) and runs by the hour.\n**Data transfer costs** : Moving data in or out of Snowflake (ingress/egress) follows Snowflake\u2019s standard rates. Snowflake also charges a small fee for data moving between compute in the same region (we\u2019ll detail that).\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services **Compute Pool Costs**\nContent:\n**Note for Enterprise or Business Critical Editions:** Replace the $2/credit rate with **$3 (Enterprise)** or **$4 (Business Critical)** and recalculate the hourly costs.\n**Bigger nodes burn credits faster** . There\u2019s also a small startup penalty: when a compute pool starts or resumes, Snowflake bills at least 5 minutes of credits up-front, then charges by the second thereafter. And note: you are charged for a pool as long as it\u2019s active (even if idle) so it\u2019s wise to configure AUTO_SUSPEND to shut nodes off when they\u2019re not needed.\nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Storage and Volume Costs\nContent:\nSnowpark Containers Service use standard Snowflake storage plus optional block storage.\n**\u27a5 Snowflake stage/table storage**\nAnything you store in a Snowflake stage or table (including container images or logs) is billed at Snowflake\u2019s normal storage rate. In US-East (Northern Virginia), standard storage is about **$23 per TB per month** (on-demand). (Rates vary by region; for example in Zurich it\u2019s **~$30 per TB per month** ). In short, *standard Snowflake data storage costs apply* . So if you have 1 TB of images in a stage, expect roughly **$23/month** in that region.\n**\u27a5 Image repository**\nSnowpark Container Services uses a Snowflake-managed stage as the container image registry. That means your container images live in a Snowflake stage and incur normal stage storage fees. There\u2019s no special discount or charge \u2013 it\u2019s just paid as regular stage storage.\n**\u27a5 Logs**\nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Storage and Volume Costs\nContent:\nIf you configure services to store local container logs in Snowflake tables (so-called *event tables* ), that data simply counts as table storage. You pay the usual storage rate on those logs.\n**\u27a5 Volume mounts**\nSnowpark lets you mount volumes into containers. If you mount a **Snowflake stage as a volume** , again you pay stage costs as above. If you mount the Snowflake **compute pool\u2019s local storage** as a volume, there\u2019s *no extra charge* beyond the compute node cost. It\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d in the sense that you\u2019ve already paid for the node\u2019s cost.\n**Block storage (persistent volumes)**\nIf you want persistent disk beyond ephemeral, Snowpark Containers Service offers block storage volumes (backed by cloud block storage). These are metered in four ways: **Volume size (TB-month)** , **IOPS usage** , **Throughput** and **Snapshot storage.**\nSnowflake Snowpark Container Service Block Storage Pricing\nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Storage and Volume Costs\nContent:\nIn summary, for storage: **standard Snowflake storage** **prices apply** for anything on stages or tables. Container-specific extras come from block volumes. Those volumes are fairly expensive (on the order of $82\u2013$100 per TB-month) but give you persistent disk. Don\u2019t forget: all these storage costs run monthly (so divide by ~730 to get a \u201cper hour\u201d sense if needed).\nSo, a quick note on storage: if you\u2019ve got data stored on stages or tables, you\u2019ll be charged the standard rates. And if you\u2019re using containers, you\u2019ll also need to pay for block volumes on top of that. Those block volumes are fairly expensive, with a price tag of around **~$82-$100 per terabyte per month** . Just remember, these costs are monthly, so if you\u2019re looking for an hourly breakdown, you can divide by 730 to get an estimate.\nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Data Transfer Costs\nContent:\nData transfer (ingress/egress) follows Snowflake\u2019s usual rules, with a small twist for Snowpark Container Services.\n**\u27a5 Ingress Cost**\n**Ingress (loading data in)** is typically free or included in your storage/compute costs. Snowflake doesn\u2019t charge to upload data into a stage (aside from your cloud provider\u2019s charges, which Snowflake does not bill).\n**\u27a5 Egress to Internet or other clouds**\nSnowflake charges by the terabyte moved out.\nOn AWS, for example, it\u2019s about **$90 per TB to the public internet** (after the first 50\u202fGB which is free in AWS accounts).\nOn Azure, the outbound internet rate is about **$87.50/TB** .\nCross-cloud egress (from AWS Snowflake to Azure) is typically **$90\u2013$120/TB** on each end.\n**\u27a5 Intra-cloud (same cloud) transfers**\nMoving data between regions or within the same cloud has its own rates.\nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Data Transfer Costs\nContent:\nOn AWS, Snowflake does **not** charge for data transfer within the same region (aside from a special SPCS fee, see below).\nTransfer to a different AWS region is about **$20/TB** .\nOn Azure, inter-region (same continent) is **~$20/TB** , cross-continent up to **~$50/TB** .\n**\u27a5 Snowpark Container Services internal data transfer**\nWhen containers move data between compute (within Snowflake), Snowflake applies a nominal fee *even if staying in the same region* . On AWS, Snowpark Container Services data transfers in the same region cost ~ **$3.07 per TB** . It\u2019s a small fee to account for internal network traffic. Also note that, Snowflake *caps* these SPCS transfer fees: any given day, your SPCS data transfer charge will be reduced by up to 10% of that day\u2019s compute cost. In effect, you never pay SPCS transfer that exceeds 10% of compute spend, which keeps it modest.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowpark Container Services 101: A comprehensive overview (2026) > Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services is available on all paid Snowflake editions in commercial regions. It is not available on trial or free-tier accounts.  In 2024 it launched on AWS, then Azure GA (Feb 2025) and Google Cloud GA (Aug 2025). So if you have a standard Enterprise or Business Critical account (non-trial) on AWS, Azure, or GCP, you should have SPCS.\n**What is a compute pool and how to size it?**\nSnowflake compute pool is a collection of virtual machine nodes that run your containers.

        "Section Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > Snowflake Overview\nContent:\nSnowflake is a data cloud platform used by organizations to store, process and analyze data. Snowflake uses the big three cloud providers for hosting - AWS (Amazon Web Services), GCP (Google Cloud Platform), and Microsoft Azure. Snowflake is a fully-managed platform, and users have no direct access to the underlying infrastructure. This is owed to Snowflake's goal of making the platform straightforward to use by managing complexity while still providing a powerful feature set.\nSnowflake's stand out features include decoupled storage and compute layers, just-in-time provisioning and automatic suspension of unused compute instances (known as virtual warehouses). The decoupled storage layer enables features such as [zero-copy cloning](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-storage) and data sharing.\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > Snowflake's Pricing Model\nContent:\nLike most cloud SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms, Snowflake utilizes usage based pricing. Rather than a fixed monthly or annual fee, Snowflake tracks usage volumes across computation, data storage and transfer, calculating costs from pre-determined rates for each.\nSnowflake has a currency called 'credits'. Snowflake Credits are consumed by performing activities within the platform - running virtual warehouses etc. The cost of each credit depends on three main factors - Snowflake edition, hosting location, and cloud provider.\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Snowflake Editions\nContent:\nYou can think of Snowflake Editions as different plans Snowflake offers.\nSnowflake currently offers four editions: Standard, Enterprise, Business Critical, and Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS). Each Snowflake Edition is differentiated by the availability of certain features. The primary differentiators are that Enterprise customers gain multi-cluster warehouses (horizontal scaling), with business critical and VPC editions focusing almost entirely on increased security and data protection. For full details on the features offered between each edition, see the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions) .\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Virtual Warehouse Pricing\nContent:\n| Warehouse Size | Credits / Hour | Snowpark-Optimized Credits / Hour |\n| X-Small | 1 | N/A |\n| Small | 2 | N/A |\n| Medium | 4 | 6 |\n| Large | 8 | 12 |\n| X-Large | 16 | 24 |\n| 2X-Large | 32 | 48 |\n| 3X-Large | 64 | 96 |\n| 4X-Large | 128 | 192 |\n| 5X-Large | 256 | 384 |\n| 6X-Large | 512 | 768 |\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Virtual Warehouse Pricing\nContent:\nEach warehouse size increment doubles the resources available. Snowpark-optimized warehouses are a newer warehouse type, with 16x the memory of the 'normal' warehouse type for each size, at 1.5X the cost.\nVirtual warehouse compute costs typically make up 80% of a Snowflake customer's bill. As a result, they are often the focus of any [cost optimization](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-cost-optimization) efforts.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Cloud Services Costs\nContent:\nSnowflake's cloud services layer is responsible for everything that isn't the actual storing and processing of data. That includes authentication, query compilation, and zero-copy cloning to name a few. Snowflake's pricing for cloud services uses a fair-use style model, where so long as cloud services usage doesn't exceed 10% of compute usage, no additional costs are incurred. For example, if a customer uses 100 compute credits, and 5 cloud services credits, they are cancelled out:\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Cloud Services Costs\nContent:\n| Service | Credits Used |\n| Compute | 100 |\n| Cloud Services | 5 |\n| Cloud Services Rebate | -5 |\n| Total | 100 |\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Cloud Services Costs\nContent:\nIf the cloud services credits increase to 15 however:\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Cloud Services Costs\nContent:\n| Service | Credits Used |\n| Compute | 100 |\n| Cloud Services | 15 |\n| Cloud Services Rebate | -10 |\n| Total | 105 |\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Cloud Services Costs\nContent:\nOnly 10 credits are rebated, calculated as 10% of the compute credits used. Therefore, the customer is charged for 5 cloud services credits.\nMost customers never pay for cloud services due to this 10% policy. Scenarios where this isn't the case are typically where a large number of simple queries are been executed, as these have a high cloud services cost relative to their compute costs.\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Snowpark Container Services Pricing\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services (SPCS) is a new (as of 2024), fully managed container offering from Snowflake. SPCS allows Snowflake customers to run containerized workloads directly in Snowflake. You can learn more about the service in the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) .\nSPCS runs on top of Compute Pools, which are different than virtual warehouses.

Consequently, it incurs costs both to Databricks directly, and in your cloud account. Databricks also offers a Serverless SQL model where the compute instances are managed by Databricks. For this service, costs are only paid to Databricks. This is more closely aligned with Snowflake and BigQuery's pricing and operating models.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Is Snowflake expensive?\nContent:\nThere is a widespread rhetoric that Snowflake is expensive, and if managed improperly, it can be. Customers not [choosing the right warehouse size](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-warehouse-sizing) or creating too many warehouses without proper controls in place can often be a culprit of runaway costs. However, all usage-based cloud platforms get expensive when not used thoughtfully, this isn't unique to Snowflake. When using the right processes, monitoring and management, Snowflake can be a very cost-effective choice for a cloud data platform. At [SELECT](https://select.dev/) , we've built our entire data platform on top of Snowflake due to its ease of use, scalability, and its cost-effectiveness.\nNiall Woodward \u00b7 Co-founder & CTO of SELECT\nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing Explained | 2025 Billing Model Guide > ... > Is Snowflake expensive?\nContent:\nNiall is the Co-Founder & CTO of SELECT, a SaaS Snowflake cost management and optimization platform.

        "Section Title: A Beginner's Guide to Snowpark Container Services: Understanding the Building Blocks and Pricing\nContent:\nJeff Skoldberg . Saturday, November 15, 2025\nCopy link\n ... \nSection Title: ... > What is Snowpark Container Services?\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services lets you run containerized applications directly inside Snowflake. It is Snowflake's version of AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or Azure Container Instances. But instead of running in your cloud account, your containers run in Snowflake's compute environment and have native access to your Snowflake data.\nThe best part is your containers can directly query Snowflake tables, call Snowflake functions, and access your data without the need to create a service account, managing credentials for data access, or moving data outside the platform. Also the users of your app will be granted access using a simple grant statement, so you don\u2019t need to build authentication software or manage user / passwords, etc. I recently deployed a container app for an AWS / Snowflake customer, and they chose SPCS instead of ECS because the user management and security is much simpler.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 1. Image Repository\nContent:\nThis is Snowflake's container registry, similar to Docker Hub or Amazon ECR. You push your Docker images here, and Snowflake pulls from it when starting your services.\n```\n1 CREATE  IMAGE REPOSITORY my_app_repo ;\n```\nSnowpark Container Services does not pull container images directly from external registries like Docker Hub. You can use public base images when building locally, but before deploying to Snowflake, you must push the final image to a **Snowflake image repository** within your account. Services can only run images stored in Snowflake\u2019s own repository system.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 4. External Access Integration (Optional)\nContent:\nIf your container needs to call external APIs or services outside Snowflake, you need an external access integration. This is Snowflake's way of controlling outbound network access.\n```\n1 CREATE  EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION my_api_access 2  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES  = ( my_network_rule ) 3  ENABLED  = TRUE ;\n```\nAs you can see, there are some new concepts here that are very specific to this service. General Snowflake knowledge or cloud knowledge will help jump start you, but you need to get these new terms under your belt.\nSection Title: ... > How much does Snowpark Container Services cost?\nContent:\nThe pricing on SPCS is quite reasonable in my opinion. It will be more expensive compared to traditional container services (ECS, Cloud Run, ACI), but the added benefits of Snowflake governance and data proximity may often be worth it. Here are the various charges associated with SPCS.\nSection Title: ... > Compute Pools\nContent:\nThe main billing component of SPCS is the compute pools. On the surface, SPCS seems to be very affordable. An Extra Small costs only 0.06 Credits per hour. At $3 per credit, an XS would cost $4.32 per day or $1576 per year. Similar hardware on Cloud Run would cost just under $3 / day. So SPCS is more expensive, but has the added benefits we discussed.\nWhen a compute pool resumes, you are billed for a minimum of 5 minutes.\nSection Title: ... > Comparison to Snowflake Virtual Warehouses costs\nContent:\nCompared to Snowflake\u2019s virtual warehouses, the smallest size warehouse costs 1 credit per hour. SPCS provides a much cheaper alternative for lightweight tasks like running Python scripts or hosting notebooks. As shown above, you can run a compute node for 6% the total cost of an XS virtual warehouse!\nSection Title: ... > Storage Costs\nContent:\nStorage is cheap, and SPCS won\u2019t burn a ton of storage, but let\u2019s be aware of this aspect. Here are the various ways you could be billed for storage:\nImage Repository: this is implemented as a stage, so standard storage rates apply.\nBlock volumes for containers: these store your application state, similar to AWS EBS or Google Persistent Disk. This is most expensive aspect when it comes to storage. Ranging from about $82 to $100 per TB per month.\nLogging to Snowflake\u2019s event table (standard storage)\nAny other stage / table used by your app (standard storage)\nSection Title: ... > SPCS Cost Management Gotcha: Public Services Don't Auto-Suspend\nContent:\nHere's where many newcomers (myself included) get surprised. If you're used to Cloud Run, AWS Lambda, ECS, or similar \"serverless\" container platforms, you might expect your service to automatically shut down when no one is using it. **It doesn't.**\nSection Title: ... > The Reality of SPCS Costs\nContent:\nBen Franklin said \"Experience is the best teacher, but a fool will learn from no other.\" Unfortunately I learned from the following the hard way, so hopefully you can learn from my mistakes!\nCompute pools have AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS, but it only applies when the pool is empty. If you have a service running on the compute pool, the pool stays active. Setting `AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS = 60` on your compute pool doesn't suspend the pool if a service is running and **services will not suspend themselves.**\nSection Title: ... > The Reality of SPCS Costs\nContent:\nServices run 24/7 by default. When you create a service with `MIN_INSTANCES = 1` , (0 is not allowed), Snowflake keeps one container running constantly. That means you're paying for compute 24/7 until you explicitly suspend the service. Unlike cloud run, it won\u2019t scale to zero when no one is using it. The `auto_suspend_secs` property of the service is a preview feature; it will work for internal apps that do not have public endpoints such as [Service Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-function-spcs) , and [Service to Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services) communications. But for web apps running in containers, they will not auto-suspend when idle. Snowflake only tracks internal service function calls for determining inactivity, not **ingress HTTP traffic** .\nSection Title: ... > The Reality of SPCS Costs\nContent:\nAs mentioned above, it is still affordable due to the low credit consumption rate, even if you let things run 24x7. ($4.32 / day assuming $3 / credit and XS). This is just something to look at for as it is came as a surprise to me.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Cost Management Strategies\nContent:\nGiven these limitations, here are practical approaches if you don\u2019t want your app to run 24x7:\n**1. Manual Suspend/Resume (Best for Dev/Test)**\n```\n1 -- When you're done working: 2 ALTER  SERVICE my_app SUSPEND ; 3 4 -- The service will auto-resume when someone accesses it 5 -- This is manual but reliable\n```\n**2. Scheduled Tasks (Good for Predictable Usage)**\n```\n1 -- Suspend every night at 6 PM 2 CREATE  TASK suspend_service_nightly 3  SCHEDULE  = 'USING CRON 0 18 * * * America/New_York' 4 AS 5 ALTER  SERVICE my_app SUSPEND ; 6 7 -- it will auto resume when someone uses next.\n```\n**3. Monitor and Alert (Essential for Production)**\nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Cost Management Strategies\nContent:\n```\n1 -- show commands don't run an a warehouse 2 SHOW  SERVICES ; 3 4 -- If you want to use sql for calcs and filtering... 5 SELECT 6  service_name , 7 status , 8  compute_pool_name , 9  current_instances , 10  DATEDIFF ( 'hour' ,  last_resumed , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ( ) ) as  hours_running 11 FROM  INFORMATION_SCHEMA . SERVICES 12 WHERE status = 'RUNNING' ;\n```\nSection Title: ... > Accessing suspended SPCS URLs\nContent:\nWhen the service is suspended, the user will reach this error when visiting the URL:\n```\n1 { 2 \"responseType\" :  \"ERROR\" , 3 \"requestId\" :  \"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" , 4 \"detail\" :  \"Service EXAMPLE_SERVICE not reachable: no service hosts found.\" 5 }\n```\nAs long as the service and compute pool have auto-resume enabled, they will begin to spin up when the user tries the URL. It will take about 39-60 seconds, then they can refresh the page. This experience is a little sub-optimal, but not terrible if the users know to expect it.\nSection Title: ... > Running Batch Jobs using Compute Pools\nContent:\nSince SPCS Compute Pools have a much cheaper cost per credit, we can leverage this as a much cheaper way to run Python (or any language) batch jobs in Snowflake. Let\u2019s say you have a Python job that is containerized and pushed to a Snowflake registry, and a YAML file that describes the service pushed to a Stage. Then you can run an `execute job service ...` command to run the code in that container. These services will turn off when they are finished, allowing the Compute Pool to auto-suspend normally. This is a nice trick to harness cheaper compute in Snowflake!\n```\n1 EXECUTE  JOB SERVICE 2 IN COMPUTE  POOL my_compute_pool 3  NAME  =  my_batch_job 4 FROM @my_stage 5  SPEC  = 'job_spec.yaml' ;\n```\nSection Title: ... > Monitoring Snowpark Container Services cost in Snowsight\nContent:\nThe Snowsight UI provides a convenient way to monitor SPCS spend. Using accountadmin role or a role with access to monitor usage, navigate to Admin \u2192 Cost Management \u2192 Consumption then change the Service Type filter to SPCS.\nSection Title: ... > Key Takeaways\nContent:\n**Compute pools don't idle if services are running** - The `AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS` setting only applies when the pool has no active services\n**You must explicitly manage service lifecycle** - Use `ALTER SERVICE ... SUSPEND` when not in use, and enable `AUTO_RESUME = TRUE` for automatic wake-up (for http apps)\n**Auto-suspend doesn't work for public endpoints** - Services with public endpoints can auto-resume but won't auto-suspend based on inactivity\n**Plan your cost management strategy upfront** - Decide whether you'll use manual suspension, scheduled tasks, or just keep services running and budget accordingly\n**Every object needs permissions** - Image repositories, stages, compute pools, external access integrations, and services all require specific grants\nSection Title: ... > Getting Started Checklist\nContent:\n\u2705 Create dedicated role for container management\n\u2705 Set up database, schema, image repository, and stage\n\u2705 Configure external access integration if calling external APIs\n\u2705 Create compute pool with appropriate size and auto-suspend settings\n\u2705 Upload service specification to stage\n\u2705 Create service with `AUTO_RESUME = TRUE`\n\u2705 Document manual suspend procedures or create scheduled tasks\n\u2705 Set up monitoring queries to track running services and costs\n\u2705 Test the suspend/resume cycle before deploying to production\nSection Title: ... > Wrap Up\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services brings the power of containerized applications directly to your data in Snowflake. But there is a learning curve; you need to understand image repositories, compute pools, services, and their interconnected behavior. Once you grasp these building blocks and the cost management quirks, you can build powerful data applications that run right next to your data without ever leaving the Snowflake platform.\nJeff Skoldberg \u00b7 Sales Engineer @ SELECT\nJeff Skoldberg is a Sales Engineer at SELECT, helping customers get maximum value out of the SELECT app to reduce their Snowflake spend.

        "Section Title: ... > **How Much Does Snowflake Cost?**\nContent:\nThe cost of using Snowflake depends on several factors, such as the services you use, the data volume, and the frequency of data processing. Snowflake\u2019s cost structure consists of several components that are each billed separately, including computing, storage, and data transfer. The flexibility to choose specific components lets you scale up or down depending on your workload, which can be very beneficial in budgeting.\nSnowflake\u2019s compute costs are usually the most significant part of the bill, accounting for around 80% of total costs. Other factors, such as data storage and transfer, contribute to the final price, but computing services are where most of your spending will be directed.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > **Components of Snowflake Pricing**\nContent:\n**Compute Costs** : Virtual warehouses where your data is processed are usually the largest part of the bill.\n**Storage Costs** : Charged per TB per month, depending on region and cloud provider.\n**Data Transfer Costs** : Charges for data egress across regions and clouds.\n**Cloud Services Costs** : Any usage beyond 10% of computing costs incurs additional charges.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing: Implementation Cost and Pricing Details [2025] > ... > **Serverless Pricing**\nContent:\nSnowflake\u2019s serverless options, like Snowpipe and Serverless tasks, provide on-demand computing resources for specialized tasks. Pricing for these features is determined by a specific multiplier, with services like Query Acceleration and Snowpipe Streaming costing as low as 1 compute credit per hour. In contrast, the Search Optimization Service is at the higher end, costing ten credits per hour.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Pricing: Implementation Cost and Pricing Details [2025] > ... > **Cloud Services Costs**\nContent:\nCloud services handle several tasks crucial for operating within Snowflake, such as authentication, query compilation, and cloning. A unique feature of Snowflake\u2019s pricing is its fair-use policy, allowing up to 10% of compute costs to be allocated to cloud services without additional charges.\nFor example, no extra charges apply if you use 100 compute credits and your cloud services usage is five credits. If your cloud services usage reaches 15 credits, only the portion exceeding 10% of the compute cost will be billed. This policy ensures that you won\u2019t pay extra for cloud services in most cases.\nSection Title: ... > **Snowpark Container Services Pricing**\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services (SPCS), currently in public preview, allows you to run containerized workloads on Snowflake.

        "Section Title: Snowflake Cost Optimization: Top 17 Techniques in 2025 > What Is Snowflake Cost Optimization?\nContent:\nSnowflake is a popular cloud-based data warehouse service. Snowflake cost optimization is the process of identifying and implementing strategies to reduce expenses while using the Snowflake data platform. Snowflake costs can accumulate from compute resources, storage, and data transfer. Optimizing costs ensures the platform is used efficiently, without sacrificing performance or functionality.\n[Learn how to optimize snowflake warehouse in 2026, automatically](https://seemoredata.io/blog/snowflake-warehouse-optimization-2026/) .\nCost optimization on Snowflake involves analyzing usage patterns, evaluating inefficiencies, and applying best practices. With Snowflake\u2019s consumption-based pricing model, users must create cost-effective query designs and limit unnecessary data processing. By understanding and addressing cost drivers, users can maximize value without exceeding budgets.\nSection Title: Snowflake Cost Optimization: Top 17 Techniques in 2025 > What Is Snowflake Cost Optimization?\nContent:\nThis is part of a series of articles about [Snowflake pricing](https://seemoredata.io/blog/understanding-snowflake-pricing/)\nSection Title: ... > In this article, we\u2019ll cover the following Snowflake cost optimization techniques:\nContent:\nOptimizing Compute Resources\nEfficient Storage Management\nQuery Performance Tuning\nMonitoring and Managing User Activity\nImplementing Data Compression and Partitioning\nQuery Acceleration\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Cost Optimization: Top 17 Techniques in 2025 > ... > Snowflake Services\nContent:\nBeyond compute, storage, and data transfer, Snowflake offers several managed services that can incur additional costs. These services are billed based on usage and are designed to provide additional functionality without requiring users to manage infrastructure.\n**Serverless Features**\nSnowflake provides serverless compute options for specific tasks, such as:\n**Snowpipe** : Automates continuous data ingestion.\n**Materialized Views** : Stores precomputed query results for faster access.\n**Search Optimization Service** : Enhances query performance on selective filters.\nThese services consume credits based on the compute resources used during their operation. Unlike virtual warehouses, which are user-managed, serverless features are managed by Snowflake and automatically scale based on workload demands. Costs are calculated per second of usage, with rates varying depending on the specific service.\nSection Title: Snowflake Cost Optimization: Top 17 Techniques in 2025 > ... > Snowflake Services\nContent:\n**Cloud Services Layer**\nThe cloud services layer encompasses various functions that coordinate activities across Snowflake, including:\n**Authentication and Security** : Managing user access and enforcing security policies.\n**Metadata Management** : Handling schema definitions, query parsing, and optimization.\n**Infrastructure Coordination** : Orchestrating operations across compute and storage layers.\nUsage of the cloud services layer incurs additional credit consumption, especially in scenarios involving:\nHigh-frequency metadata operations (e.g., frequent DDL statements).\nComplex query compilations.\nFrequent use of administrative commands or third-party tools that interact with metadata.\nMonitoring and optimizing interactions with the cloud services layer can help manage these costs.\n**Snowpark Container Services**\nSection Title: Snowflake Cost Optimization: Top 17 Techniques in 2025 > ... > Snowflake Services\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services allow users to run containerized applications and services within Snowflake\u2019s environment.

        "Section Title: Snowflake Compute Costs: Complete 2025 Guide\nContent:\nBy Amir Peres\nJuly 5, 2025 | 5 min read\nIf you were shocked by the first \u2013 or second, or third, or fourth \u2013 Snowflake bill, you\u2019re not alone. Snowflake is a great tool to use, but its pricing structure can be equally opaque. The key to getting those costs down is to understand exactly where your money is going.\n[Snowflake pricing](https://yukidata.com/blog/snowflake-costs-pricing-guide/) is based on consumption. In other words: you only pay for what you use. This guide will look into how Snowflake compute costs work, specifically diving into:\nWhat Snowflake compute costs are exactly\nHow Snowflake compute costs work\nHow to optimize your Snowflake compute services\nSection Title: Snowflake Compute Costs: Complete 2025 Guide > What are Snowflake Compute Costs\nContent:\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at what exactly Snowflake compute costs are. Compute costs represent how your Snowflake credits \u2013 how you pay for services in Snowflake \u2013 are used.\nDepending on the service you use, the credit will act differently:\n**Virtual warehouse compute** uses credits as it functions. Since Virtual warehouses are user-managed, you can directly control resource credit consumption.\n**Serverless compute** uses Snowflake managed resources instead of virtual warehouses.\n**Compute pools** are the compute resource source for Snowpark Container Services.\n**Cloud Services** is the Snowflake-managed architecture layer that ties together Snowflake components like users request processing, login, query, and display.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each of these compute features to see how exactly they work to use your Snowflake credit.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Compute Costs: Complete 2025 Guide > ... > Compute Pool Credit Costs\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services uses compute pools for jobs and services. A compute pool is a collection of one or more virtual machine nodes. How many nodes and the type of nodes used determines how many credits a job or service will consume. Snowpark Container Services meters usage per node-second. pricing multipliers vary by node class (Standard-S, Standard-M, High-Memory, GPU).\nSection Title: Snowflake Compute Costs: Complete 2025 Guide > ... > Cloud Service Credit Costs\nContent:\nThe cloud service layer, just like the serverless credit layer, uses a collection of services to coordinate tasks and activities across your Snowflake platform. The cloud service layer is made up of stateless compute resources operating under a highly available metadata store.\nThese are just a few things the cloud service layer manages:\nUser authentication\nSecurity enforcement\nQuery compilation and optimization creation\nQuery request caching\nCloud service billing works differently than other compute costs. You\u2019re charged when daily cloud service usage exceeds 10% of your virtual warehouse consumption for the day.\nHere\u2019s how it works: if you use 100 credits on warehouses and 15 credits on cloud services, you\u2019ll only pay for five cloud service credits (15 minutes the 10% free allowance). If cloud services stay under 10%, you pay nothing extra.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake Compute Costs: Complete 2025 Guide > Common Snowflake Compute Cost Mistakes to Avoid\nContent:\nBefore diving into optimization strategies, here are the biggest compute cost traps to avoid to keep your bill manageable:\n**Leaving virtual warehouses running:** This is the biggest compute killer. A large  warehouse consumes eight credits per hour. Leaving it on for eight idle hours (\u2018overnight\u2019 in this example) burns 8 credits / hour \u00d7 8 hours = 64 unused credits.\n**Wrong warehouse sizing:** Using an XL warehouse (16 credits per hour) for a quick data check wastes compute power. On the other hand, using an XS (one credit per hour) for heavy processing will also use more compute because of the longer runtimes.\n**But remember, b** igger can be cheaper, credit consumption is size \u00d7 time. A larger warehouse that finishes a query faster can cost the same or less than a smaller one that runs longer."

        "Section Title: ... > 1. MATERIALIZED VIEW\nContent:\n**What is a Materialized view ?** Materialized views are Snowflake objects which are intended to *improve the performance of query* workloads by having precomputed dataset stored for a later use. And as the data is precomputed querying a materialized view is faster than executing a query against a table. This is a feature available in ***Snowflake\u2019s Enterprise Edition*** and above.\n*Cost of using this feature* : Materialized views if used would incur both \u201cStorage\u201d && \u201cCompute\u201d costs. It uses snowflake managed compute & storage resources which are paid for with snowflake credits and are billed per second.\n**Storage cost** \u2192 Materialized view would be storing the query results that adds to monthly storage cost of the billing.\nSection Title: ... > 1. MATERIALIZED VIEW\nContent:\n**Compute cost** \u2192 Snowflake automatically maintains the materialized view whenever there is any change in the base table\u2019s data by using the background service of Snowflake which uses compute resources hence the cost is associated with compute.\nNow, all these can significantly add to the overall billing if this feature is not used by having right understanding.\n**Best practices to manage cost of this service:**\n*1. Deciding on when to use materialized views:* Some of the best practices includes create a materialized view on tables which do not change that frequently, queries which are on external tables, query results are often very compute intensive like analyzing semi-structured data.\n*2. Clustering capability:* Do not add a clustering key on a base table which changes very frequently. Add a clustering key only when materialized view is accessed frequently and base table is not that frequenrly accessed.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 2. SEARCH OPTIMIZATION SERVICE\nContent:\n***Compute Cost*** \u2192 Maintaining the search optimization service also requires resources. Resource consumption is higher when there is high churn (i.e. when large volumes of data in the table change). These costs are roughly proportional to the amount of data ingested (added or changed). Deletes also have some cost.\n**Best practices to manage cost of this service:**\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 5. REPLICATION\nContent:\nFurther drilling down at a *database level* the replication utilization would be shown as a special Snowflake-provided warehouse named \u201c *REPLICATION* **\u201d.** Below are the objects which can be also queried to get the database level metrics.\n```\n1. DATABASE_REPLICATION_USAGE_HISTORY table function(in the Snowflake Information Schema). This function returns database replication usage activity within the last 14 days.  \n2. DATABASE_REPLICATION_USAGE_HISTORY View view(in Account Usage). This view returns database replication usage activity within the last 365 days (1 year).\n```\n**OTHER MANAGED SERVICES:**\nWe covered 5 Snowflake managed services and their cost management strategy which are most widely used. However Snowflake also has 3 more managed services ie., ***External Tables, Snowpipe Streaming, Tasks*** .
