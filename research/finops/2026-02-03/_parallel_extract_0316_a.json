[¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nThe total cost of using Snowflake is the aggregate of the cost of using data transfer, storage, and compute resources. Snowflake’s\ninnovative [cloud architecture](intro-key-concepts) separates the cost of accomplishing any task into one of these\nusage types.\nCompute Resources\nUsing compute resources within Snowflake consumes Snowflake credits. The billed cost of using compute resources is\ncalculated by multiplying the number of consumed credits by the price of a credit. For the current price of a credit, see the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\nThere are three types of compute resources that consume credits within Snowflake:\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > How are costs incurred? [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n**Virtual Warehouse Compute** : [Virtual warehouses](warehouses) are user-managed compute resources that consume\ncredits when loading data, executing queries, and performing other DML operations. Because Snowflake utilizes per-second billing (with a\n60-second minimum each time the warehouse starts), warehouses are billed only for the credits they actually consume when they are\nactively working.\n**Serverless Compute** : There are Snowflake features such as Search Optimization and Snowpipe that use Snowflake-managed compute\nresources rather than virtual warehouses. To minimize cost, these serverless compute resources are automatically resized and scaled\nup or down by Snowflake as required for each workload.\n**Cloud Services Compute** : The cloud services layer of the Snowflake architecture consumes credits as it performs behind-the-scenes\ntasks such as authentication, metadata management, and access control. Usage of the cloud services layer is charged only if the daily\nconsumption of cloud services resources exceeds 10% of the daily warehouse usage.\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > How are costs incurred? [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nFor more details about compute costs, see [Understanding compute cost](cost-understanding-compute) .\nStorage Resources\nThe monthly cost for storing data in Snowflake is based on a flat rate per terabyte (TB). For the current rate, which\nvaries depending on your type of account (Capacity or On Demand) and region (US or EU), see the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\nStorage is calculated monthly based on the average number of on-disk bytes stored each day in your Snowflake account.\nFor more details about storage costs, see [Understanding storage cost](cost-understanding-data-storage) .\nData Transfer Resources\nSnowflake does not charge data ingress fees to bring data into your account, but does charge for data egress.\nSnowflake charges a per-terabyte fee when you transfer data from a Snowflake account into a different region on the same cloud platform or into a completely different cloud platform. This fee for data egress depends on the region where your Snowflake account is hosted. For details,\nsee the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\nFor more details about data transfer costs, see [Understanding data transfer cost](cost-understanding-data-transfer) .\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nThe following example provides insight into the total cost in Snowflake to load and query data.\nSuppose an organization loads data constantly, 24x7. It has two different groups of users (Finance and Sales) using the database in\noverlapping, but different times of the day. It also runs a weekly batch report. This organization:\nUses the Standard Edition of Snowflake.\nStores an average of 65 TBs of compressed data (compare with 325 TB without compression).\nLoads data 24x7x365. They use a Small Standard virtual warehouse for this purpose.\nEnables seven finance users to work 5 days a week from 8am until 5pm using a Large Standard virtual warehouse.\nEnables twelve sales users in different geographies to work a total of 16 hours a day (across Europe and the Americas), 5 days a\nweek using a Medium Standard virtual warehouse.\nRuns a complex weekly report every Friday. This report takes approximately 2 hours to run on a 2X-Large standard warehouse.\n**Data Loading Requirements**\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n| Parameter | Customer Requirement | Configuration | Cost |\n| Loading Window | 24 x 7 x 365 | Small Standard Virtual Warehouse (2 credits/hr) | 1,488 credits |\n| (2 credits/hr x 24 hours per day x 31 days per month) |  |  |  |\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n**Storage Requirements**\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n| Data set size (per month) | 65 TB (after compression) |\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n**Compute Requirements**\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n| Parameter | Customer Requirement | Configuration | Cost |\n| Finance Users | 5 Users, 8am-5pm (9 hours) | Large Standard Virtual Warehouse (8 credits/hr) | 1,440 credits (8 credits/hr x 9 hours per day x 20 days per month) |\n| Sales Users | 12 Users, 16 hour time slot | Medium Standard Virtual Warehouse (4 credits/hr) | 1,280 (4 credits/hr x 16 hours per day x 20 days per month) |\n| Complex Query Users | 1 User, 2 hours/day | 2X Standard Virtual Warehouse (32 credits/hr) | 256 (32 credits/hr x 2 hours per day x 4 days per month) |\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n**Total Cost**\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n| Usage Type | Monthly Cost | Total Billed Cost |\n| Compute Cost | 4,464 credits (@ $2/credit) | $8928 |\n| Storage Cost | 65 TB (@ $23/TB) | $1495 |\n| $10,423 |  |  |\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > Total cost example [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n**Next Topics**\n[Understanding compute cost](cost-understanding-compute)\n[Understanding storage cost](cost-understanding-data-storage)\n[Understanding data transfer cost](cost-understanding-data-transfer)\nWas this page helpful?\nYes No\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n[Share your feedback](/feedback)\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n[Privacy Notice](https://www.snowflake.com/privacy-policy/) [Site Terms](https://www.snowflake.com/legal/snowflake-site-terms/) Cookies Settings © 2026 Snowflake, Inc.
