They scale independently, and you can have more than one running at a time. The key thing to know here: compute is paid using Snowflake credits. You spin up a warehouse, and you start spending credits. You pause it, it stops costing you. Sounds fair, but it also means you’ve got to stay on top of usage.\nSection Title: Snowflake cost optimization: 8 proven strategies for reducing costs > ... > Cloud services layer\nContent:\nThis layer handles all the coordination across the platform, such as authentication, metadata management, and query optimization. It also runs on Snowflake credits, but the cost here is usually a smaller percentage compared to compute. Still, it adds up if you’ve got a lot going on, especially with serverless features in play.\nSpeaking of credits, let’s clarify this: a Snowflake credit is a unit that measures usage.\nOne credit = one unit of usage. Simple. You’re charged credits whenever you’re running a virtual warehouse, leveraging cloud services, or tapping into Snowflake’s serverless features.\nOne more component that Snowflake charges is data transfer between cloud regions or providers. This applies if you’re using features like external tables or exporting data from Snowflake to a data lake.\nSection Title: Snowflake cost optimization: 8 proven strategies for reducing costs > ... > Cloud services layer\nContent:\nThese Snowflake cost components vary depending on whether you’re on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud (GCP), and the pricing structure for that is a bit more granular.\nLook at the tables below for Snowflake data transfer charges for AWS, Azure, and GCP:\n[AWS pricing guide: [Snowflake data transfer charges](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) ] [Azure pricing guide: [Snowflake data transfer charges](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) ] [GCP pricing guide: [Snowflake data transfer charges](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) ]\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 1.

Snowflake’s\ninnovative cloud architecture separates the cost of accomplishing any task into one of these\nusage types.\nCompute Resources\nUsing compute resources within Snowflake consumes Snowflake credits. The billed cost of using compute resources is\ncalculated by multiplying the number of consumed credits by the price of a credit. For the current price of a credit, see the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\nThere are three types of compute resources that consume credits within Snowflake:\nSection Title: Understanding overall cost ¶ > How are costs incurred? ¶\nContent:\n**Virtual Warehouse Compute** : Virtual warehouses are user-managed compute resources that consume\ncredits when loading data, executing queries, and performing other DML operations. Because Snowflake utilizes per-second billing (with a\n60-second minimum each time the warehouse starts), warehouses are billed only for the credits they actually consume when they are\nactively working. **Serverless Compute** : There are Snowflake features such as Search Optimization and Snowpipe that use Snowflake-managed compute\nresources rather than virtual warehouses. To minimize cost, these serverless compute resources are automatically resized and scaled\nup or down by Snowflake as required for each workload. **Cloud Services Compute** : The cloud services layer of the Snowflake architecture consumes credits as it performs behind-the-scenes\ntasks such as authentication, metadata management, and access control.\n ... \nSection Title: Understanding overall cost ¶ > Total cost example ¶\nContent:\n| Parameter | Customer Requirement | Configuration | Cost |\n| Loading Window | 24 x 7 x 365 | Small Standard Virtual Warehouse (2 credits/hr) | 1,488 credits |\n| (2 credits/hr x 24 hours per day x 31 days per month) |  |  |  |\n ... \nSection Title: Understanding overall cost ¶ > Total cost example ¶\nContent:\n| Parameter | Customer Requirement | Configuration | Cost |\n| Finance Users | 5 Users, 8am-5pm (9 hours) | Large Standard Virtual Warehouse (8 credits/hr) | 1,440 credits (8 credits/hr x 9 hours per day x 20 days per month) |\n| Sales Users | 12 Users, 16 hour time slot | Medium Standard Virtual Warehouse (4 credits/hr) | 1,280 (4 credits/hr x 16 hours per day x 20 days per month) |\n| Complex Query Users | 1 User, 2 hours/day | 2X Standard Virtual Warehouse (32 credits/hr) | 256 (32 credits/hr x 2 hours per day x 4 days per month) |"]},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro","title":"Introduction to tasks - Snowflake Documentation","excerpts":["Section Title: Introduction to tasks ¶ > Viewing the task history for your account ¶\nContent:\nTo view task history, see either the TASK_HISTORY table function or the Tasks page on Snowsight .\nFor information about required privileges, see Viewing task history .\nTo view the run history for a single task:\nSQL :\nQuery the TASK_HISTORY table function (in the Snowflake Information Schema ).\nTo view details on a task graph run that is currently scheduled or is running:\nSQL :\nQuery the CURRENT_TASK_GRAPHS table function (in the Snowflake Information Schema ).\nTo view the history for task graph runs that completed successfully, failed, or were cancelled in the past 60 minutes:\nSQL :\nQuery the COMPLETE_TASK_GRAPHS table function (in the Snowflake Information Schema ).Query the COMPLETE_TASK_GRAPHS view view (in Account Usage ).\nSection Title: Introduction to tasks ¶ > Task costs ¶\nContent:\nThe costs associated with running a task to run SQL code differ depending on the source of the compute resources for the task:\nUser-managed warehouse\nSnowflake bills your account for credit usage based on warehouse usage while a task is\nrunning, similar to the warehouse usage for running the same SQL statements in a client or the Snowflake web interface.
