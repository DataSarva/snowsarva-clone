        "Guides Cost & Billing Visibility Attributing cost\n\n# Attributing cost \u00b6\n\nAn organization can apportion the cost of using Snowflake to logical units within the organization (for example, to different\ndepartments, environments, or projects). This chargeback or showback model is useful for accounting purposes and pinpoints\nareas of the organization that could benefit from controls and optimizations that can reduce costs.\n\nTo attribute costs to different groups like departments or projects, use the following recommended approach:\n\n* Use object tags to associate resources and users with departments or projects.\n* Use query tags to associate individual queries with departments or projects when the queries are\n  made by the same application on behalf of users belonging to multiple departments.\n\n## Types of cost attribution scenarios \u00b6\n\nThe following cost attribution scenarios are the most commonly encountered. In these scenarios, warehouses are used as an\nexample of a resource that incurs costs.\n\n* **Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate\n  warehouses with a department. You can use these object tags to attribute the costs incurred by those warehouses to that\n  department entirely.\n  \n  \n* **Resources that are shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of this is a warehouse shared by users from\n  different departments. In this case, you use object tags to associate each user with a department. The costs of queries are\n  attributed to the users. Using the object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by department.\n  \n  \n* **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\n  queries on behalf of its users. In this case, each query executed by the application is assigned a query tag that identifies\n  the team or cost center of the user on whose behalf the query is being made.\n  \n  \n\nThe next sections explain how to set up object tags in your accounts and provide the details for each of these cost attribution\nscenarios.\n\n## Setting up object tags for cost attribution \u00b6\n\nWhen you set up tags to represent the groupings that you want to use for cost attribution, you should determine if the\ngroupings apply to a single account or multiple accounts. This determines how you set up your tags.\n\nFor example, suppose that you want to attribute costs based on department.\n\n* If the resources used by the department are located in a single account, you create the tags in a database in that account.\n* If the resources used by the department span multiple accounts, you create the tags in a key account in your organization (for example, in your organization account ),\n  and you make those tags available in other accounts through replication .\n\nThe next sections explain how to create the tags, replicate the tags, and apply the tags to resources.\n\n* Creating the tags\n* Replicating the tag database\n* Tagging the resources and users\n\nNote\n\nThe examples in these sections use the custom role `tag_admin` , which is assumed to have been granted the privileges to\ncreate and manage tags. Within your organization, you can use more granular privileges for object tagging to develop a secure tagging strategy.\n\n### Creating the tags \u00b6\n\nAs part of designing the strategy, decide on the database and schema where you plan to create the tags.\n\n* You can create a dedicated database and schema for the tags.\n* If you want to tag resources in different accounts across your organization, you can create the tags in a key account in your\n  organization (for example, in your organization account ).\n\nThe following example creates a database named `cost_management` and a schema named `tags` for the tags that you plan to use:\n\n```\nUSE ROLE tag_admin ; \n\n CREATE DATABASE cost_management ; \n CREATE SCHEMA tags ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nWith `cost_management` and `tags` selected as the current database and schema, create a tag named `cost_center` and set\nthe values allowed for the tag to the names of cost centers:\n\n```\nCREATE TAG cost_center \n  ALLOWED_VALUES 'finance' , 'marketing' , 'engineering' , 'product' ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\n### Replicating the tag database \u00b6\n\nIf you have an organization with multiple accounts and you want to make the tags available in these other accounts, set up your accounts for replication , and create a replication group in a main account (for example, in the organization account ). Set up this replication group to replicate the database\ncontaining the tags.\n\nFor example, to replicate the tags to the accounts named `my_org.my_account` and `my_org.my_account_2` , execute this\nstatement in your organization account:\n\n```\nCREATE REPLICATION GROUP cost_management_repl_group \n  OBJECT_TYPES = DATABASES \n  ALLOWED_DATABASES = cost_management \n  ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS = my_org . my_account_1 , my_org . my_account_2 \n  REPLICATION_SCHEDULE = '10 MINUTE' ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThen, in each account in which you want to make the tags available, create a secondary replication group, and refresh this\ngroup from the primary group:\n\n```\nCREATE REPLICATION GROUP cost_management_repl_group \n  AS REPLICA OF my_org . my_org_account . cost_management_repl_group ; \n\n ALTER REPLICATION GROUP cost_management_repl_group REFRESH ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\n### Tagging the resources and users \u00b6\n\nAfter creating and replicating the tags, you can use these tags to identify the warehouses and users belonging to each\ndepartment. For example, because the sales department uses both `warehouse1` and `warehouse2` , you can set the `cost_center` tag to `'SALES'` for both warehouses.\n\nTip\n\nIdeally, you should have workflows that automate the process of applying these tags when you create resources and users.\n\n```\nUSE ROLE tag_admin ; \n\n ALTER WAREHOUSE warehouse1 SET TAG cost_management . tags . cost_center = 'SALES' ; \n ALTER WAREHOUSE warehouse2 SET TAG cost_management . tags . cost_center = 'SALES' ; \n ALTER WAREHOUSE warehouse3 SET TAG cost_management . tags . cost_center = 'FINANCE' ; \n\n ALTER USER finance_user SET TAG cost_management . tags . cost_center = 'FINANCE' ; \n ALTER USER sales_user SET TAG cost_management . tags . cost_center = 'SALES' ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\n## Viewing cost by tag in SQL \u00b6\n\nYou can attribute costs within an account or across accounts in an organization:\n\n* **Attributing costs within an account**\n  \n  You can attribute costs within an account by querying the following views in the ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema:\n  \n    + TAG\\_REFERENCES view : Identifies objects (for example, warehouses and users) that have tags.\n    + WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY view : Provides credit usage for warehouses.\n    + QUERY\\_ATTRIBUTION\\_HISTORY view : Provides the compute costs for queries. The cost per query is\n        the warehouse credit usage for executing the query.\n        \n        For more information on using this view, see About the QUERY\\_ATTRIBUTION\\_HISTORY view .\n* **Attributing costs across accounts in an organization**\n  \n  Within an organization, you can also attribute costs for resources that are used **exclusively by a single department** by\n  querying views in the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema from the organization account .\n  \n  Note\n  \n    + In the ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema, the TAG\\_REFERENCES view is only available in the organization account.\n    + The QUERY\\_ATTRIBUTION\\_HISTORY view is only available in the ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema for an account. There is no\n        organization-wide equivalent of the view.\n\nThe next sections explain how to attribute costs for some of the common cost-attribution scenarios :\n\n* Resources not shared by departments\n* Resources shared by users from different departments\n* Resources used by applications that need to attribute costs to different departments\n\n### Resources not shared by departments \u00b6\n\nSuppose that you want to attribute costs by department and that each department uses a set of dedicated warehouses.\n\nIf you tag warehouses with a `cost_center` tag to identify the department that owns the warehouse, you can join the\nACCOUNT\\_USAGE TAG\\_REFERENCES view with the WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY view on the `object_id` and `warehouse_id` columns to get usage\ninformation by warehouse, and you can use the `tag_value` column to identify the departments that own those warehouses.\n\nThe following SQL statement performs this join:\n\n```\nSELECT \n    TAG_REFERENCES . tag_name , \n    COALESCE ( TAG_REFERENCES . tag_value , 'untagged' ) AS tag_value , \n    SUM ( WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY . credits_used_compute ) AS total_credits \n  FROM \n    SNOWFLAKE .

The rest of the query\ndoes not change.\n\n```\nSELECT \n    TAG_REFERENCES . tag_name , \n    COALESCE ( TAG_REFERENCES . tag_value , 'untagged' ) AS tag_value , \n    SUM ( WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY . credits_used_compute ) AS total_credits \n  FROM \n    SNOWFLAKE .

You can tag the users with a `cost_center` tag to identify the department that they belong to, and you can join\nthe TAG\\_REFERENCES view with the QUERY\\_ATTRIBUTION\\_HISTORY view .\n\nNote\n\nYou can only get this data for a single account at a time. You cannot execute a query that retrieves this data across\naccounts in an organization.\n\nThe next sections provide examples of SQL statements for attributing costs for shared resources.\n\n* Calculating the cost of user queries for the last month\n* Calculating the cost of user queries by department without idle time\n* Calculating the cost of queries by users without idle time\n* Calculating the cost of queries by users without tags\n\n#### Calculating the cost of user queries for the last month \u00b6\n\nThis following SQL statement calculates the costs for the last month.\n\nIn this example, idle time is distributed among the users in proportion to their usage.\n\n```\nWITH \n  wh_bill AS ( \n    SELECT SUM ( credits_used_compute ) AS compute_credits \n      FROM SNOWFLAKE .

You can access this data in Snowsight .\n\n1. Switch to a role that has access to the ACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema .\n2. In the navigation menu, select Admin \u00bb Cost management .\n3. Select Consumption .\n4. From the Tags drop-down, select the `cost_center` tag.\n5. To focus on a specific cost center, select a value from the list of the tag\u2019s values.\n6. Select Apply .\n\nFor more details about filtering in Snowsight, see Filter by tag .\n\n## About the QUERY\\_ ATTRIBUTION\\_ HISTORY view \u00b6\n\nYou can use the QUERY\\_ATTRIBUTION\\_HISTORY view to attribute cost based on queries. The cost per\nquery is the warehouse credit usage for executing the query. This cost does not include any other credit usage that is incurred\nas a result of query execution. For example, the following are not included in the query cost:\n\n* Data transfer costs\n* Storage costs\n* Cloud services costs\n* Costs for serverless features\n* Costs for tokens processed by AI services\n\nFor queries that are executed concurrently, the cost of the warehouse is attributed to individual queries based on the weighted\naverage of their resource consumption during a given time interval.\n\nThe cost per query does not include warehouse _idle time_ . Idle time is a period of time in which no queries are running in the\nwarehouse and can be measured at the warehouse level.\n\n## Additional examples of queries \u00b6\n\nThe next sections provide additional queries that you can use for cost attribution:\n\n* Grouping similar queries\n* Attributing costs of hierarchical queries\n\n### Grouping similar queries \u00b6\n\nFor recurrent or similar queries, use the `query_hash` or `query_parameterized_hash` to group costs\nby query.\n\nTo find the most expensive recurrent queries for the current month, execute the following statement:\n\n```\nSELECT query_parameterized_hash , \n       COUNT (*) AS query_count , \n       SUM ( credits_attributed_compute ) AS total_credits \n  FROM SNOWFLAKE . ACCOUNT_USAGE . QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY \n  WHERE start_time >= DATE_TRUNC ( 'MONTH' , CURRENT_DATE ) \n  AND start_time < CURRENT_DATE \n  GROUP BY query_parameterized_hash \n  ORDER BY total_credits DESC \n  LIMIT 20 ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nFor an additional query based on query ID, see Examples .\n\n### Attributing costs of hierarchical queries \u00b6\n\nFor stored procedures that issue multiple hierarchical queries, you can compute the attributed query costs for the\nprocedure by using the root query ID for the procedure.\n\n1. To find the root query ID for a stored procedure, use the ACCESS\\_HISTORY view . For example,\n   to find the root query ID for a stored procedure, set the `query_id` and execute the following statements:\n   \n   ```\n   SET query_id = '<query_id>' ; \n   \n    SELECT query_id , \n          parent_query_id , \n          root_query_id , \n          direct_objects_accessed \n     FROM SNOWFLAKE . ACCOUNT_USAGE . ACCESS_HISTORY \n     WHERE query_id = $ query_id ;\n   ```\n   \n   Copy\n   \n   For more information, see Ancestor queries with stored procedures .\n2. To sum the query cost for the entire procedure, replace `<root_query_id>` and execute the following statements:\n   \n   ```\n   SET query_id = '<root_query_id>' ; \n   \n    SELECT SUM ( credits_attributed_compute ) AS total_attributed_credits \n     FROM SNOWFLAKE . ACCOUNT_USAGE . QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY \n     WHERE ( root_query_id = $ query_id OR query_id = $ query_id );\n   ```\n   \n   Copy\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)"
