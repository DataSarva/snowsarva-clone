It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Business Impact > Overview > Consider cost as a design constraint\nContent:\nAt the ingestion layer, best practices include balancing latency versus\ncost by selecting appropriate services (e.g., Snowpipe, Snowpipe\nStreaming, or third-party tools) and choosing the right storage format\n(e.g., native tables, Iceberg). For transformations, design with\nfrequency versus SLA in mind to ensure data freshness matches the\nbusiness need. For analytics, apply schema design best practices such as\nthoughtful clustering key choices and pruning strategies to reduce\nconsumed credits. In distribution, optimize data transfer by monitoring\negress patterns and applying cost-saving practices like the [Snowflake Data Transfer Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) .\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nThis\nsignificantly reduces the manual effort required for tagging and\nensures that new objects created within a tagged schema or propagated\nworkflow automatically inherit the correct cost attribution. Snowflake\nstrongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\nto enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\nWAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS to allocate usage\nto relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\nSnowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Track usage data for all platform resources**\nTo deliver clear and actionable consumption insights, it is essential to\nleverage the rich usage data that Snowflake natively provides.

When it comes to Snowflake, that means balancing performance, cost, and quality across your data platform – all while maintaining business agility\nUnlike your traditional cloud FinOps that focus on infrastructure, Snowflake FinOps requires managing:\nSection Title: Snowflake FinOps: Complete Guide to Automated Cost Optimization > What is FinOps for Snowflake?\nContent:\n**Credit-based consumption:** At $2-4 per credit (depending on your region and edition) with cost scaling linearly from X-Small (1 credit/hour) to 6X-Large (512 credits/hour).\n**Query-level optimization:** Using QUERY_HISTORY and WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY views to identify expensive queries before they ruin your budget.\n**Dynamic warehouse scaling:** Beyond basic auto-suspend, implementing intelligent scaling based on queue depth and query complexity\n**Storage and** [**data transfer**](https://yukidata.com/blog/snowflake-data-transfer-costs-complete-guide/) **:** Long-term storage and cross-regional replication can add significant costs if not managed with lifestyle policies and governance.\nSection Title: Snowflake FinOps: Complete Guide to Automated Cost Optimization > What is FinOps for Snowflake?\nContent:\nThe big challenge here? Manual management. That same hands-on approach that worked so well for traditional infrastructure of the past breaks down when you apply the same method to millions of queries and dozens of ever-changing warehouses.\n*With Yuki, warehouse optimization is automated with a single toggle – no more manual resizing or monitoring.*\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake FinOps: Complete Guide to Automated Cost Optimization > ... > The Speed vs. Cost Dilemma\nContent:\nFast-growing companies always run into this growing pain: should they optimize for speed or for cost? Most choose speed, leaving them with:\n**Overprovisioned warehouses** to avoid performance bottlenecks\n**Warehouse sprawl** as teams created dedicated resources for SLAs\n**Idle compute** running 24/7 “just in case”\nThe result? Snowflake costs outgrowing revenue and eating into margin and ROI.\nSection Title: Snowflake FinOps: Complete Guide to Automated Cost Optimization > ... > The Compliance Complexity\nContent:\nEnterprise FinOps needs control, not just cost reduction. You’ll find manual approaches falling short of this:\n**Granular spend attribution** across cost centers and teams\n**Real-time budget enforcement** to prevent runaway costs\n**Audit trails** for compliance and chargeback scenarios\n**Role-based access** maintaining security while enabling autonomy\nThese challenges only continue to compound as you scale, making manual management not just expensive, but impossible to maintain.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > : Implement Granular Cost Attribution\nContent:\n**The problem:** Snowflake’s native cost reporting only shows warehouse-level spending. You need query- and team-level attribution for effective chargeback.\n**The solution:** Build automated tagging and attribution using Snowflake’s metadata like this:\n```\n-- Set up cost attribution table\nCREATE TABLE cost_attribution AS\nSELECT\n  qh.query_id,\n  qh.user_name,\n  qh.warehouse_name,\n  qh.database_name,\n  qh.schema_name,\n  qh.credits_used_cloud_services,\n  -- Extract team from username pattern or use session context\n  CASE\n    WHEN qh.user_name ILIKE '%analytics%' THEN 'Analytics Team'\n    WHEN qh.user_name ILIKE '%eng%' THEN 'Engineering Team'\n    ELSE 'General'\n  END as team_attribution,\n  qh.start_time\nFROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history qh\nWHERE qh.start_time >= dateadd(day, -30, current_timestamp());\n```\nYou can use this to pull key metrics like:\n ... \nSection Title: ... > : Automated Chargeback and Showback Models\nContent:\n**The problem:** No clear cost attribution means that teams often treat Snowflake as if it were “free,” leading to wasteful usage and budget overruns.\n**The solution:** Automated cost attribution that gets you accountability without expensive administration overhead:\n**Tag-based attribution** that automatically assigns costs to projects and business units\n**Usage-based chargeback** for shared warehouses using per-query\n**Predictive showback** forecasting team spend based on current trends\n**ROI tracking** connecting data platform costs to business outcomes\nManual tagging doesn’t scale. You need systems that automatically attribute costs based on your usage patterns, user roles, and business context.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > : Automated Warehouse Scaling\nContent:\n**The problem:** Snowflake’s auto-suspend helps with idle time, but it doesn’t actually optimize warehouse size when it comes to workload complexity.\n**The solution:** Implement workload-aware scaling. For example, use Snowflake’s WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY to track query depth and concurrency, then programmatically adjust sizes via Snowflake Python Connector or Snowpark API:\n```\nimport snowflake.connector\n\nconn = snowflake.connector.connect(\n    user='USER',\n    password='PASSWORD',\n    account='ACCOUNT'\n)\n\ncur = conn.cursor()\ncur.execute(\"\"\"\nSELECT AVG(avg_queued_load)\nFROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_load_history\nWHERE warehouse_name='COMPUTE_WH'\nAND start_time >= dateadd(minute, -5, current_timestamp());\n\"\"\")\n\nqueue_depth = cur.fetchone()[0]\n\nif queue_depth > 50:\n    cur.execute(\"ALTER WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'\")\nelif queue_depth < 10:\n    cur.execute(\"ALTER WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'\n```\nSection Title: ... > : Automated Warehouse Scaling\nContent:\nThis approach can help you [reduce warehouse costs](https://yukidata.com/blog/snowflake-warehouse-optimization-guide/) by 20-40% because it lets you match your compute size to actual workload requirements.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Fix #2: Identifying Cost Drivers\nContent:\nBefore you dig into automation, you need visibility. This query helps you quickly find your top cost drivers (i.e., those users and queries that are burning through the bulk of your credits) so you can decide if you need to optimize, reclassify, or reallocate workloads.\n```\n-- Find your most expensive queries from the last 30 days\nSELECT\n  query_text,\n  warehouse_name,\n  total_elapsed_time/1000 as seconds,\n  credits_used_cloud_services,\n  (credits_used_cloud_services * 3) as estimated_cost_usd\nFROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history\nWHERE start_time >= dateadd(day, -30, current_timestamp())\nORDER BY credits_used_cloud_services DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\nSection Title: ... > Fix #3: Optimizing Warehouse Sizing\nContent:\nThis lets you align your warehouse size with actual usage so you can avoid the trap of running a Large warehouse for a workload that only needs a Small.\n```\nSELECT\n  warehouse_name,\n  avg(avg_running) as avg_concurrent_queries,\n  avg(avg_queued_load) as avg_queue_depth\nFROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_load_history\nWHERE start_time >= dateadd(day, -7, current_timestamp())\nGROUP BY warehouse_name;\n```\nIf your avg_queue_depth > 100: Scale up your warehouse\nIf avg_concurrent_queries < 1: Consider smaller warehouses or using a longer auto-suspend\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Multi-Region Compliance & Data Residency\nContent:\nGlobal enterprises have to maintain data residency requirements while continuing to optimize costs across different regions. Doing this manually means having to carefully balance regulatory compliance and [cost optimization](https://yukidata.com/blog/snowflake-optimization-guide/) across multiple geographic regions and regulatory frameworks.\n**The solution:** Use automated, region-aware optimization. This lets you maintain compliance while minimizing cross-region data movement costs. Think intelligent query routing that processes all you need within boundaries, optimizing for cost and performance and getting you the best of both worlds.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake FinOps: Complete Guide to Automated Cost Optimization > The Future of Snowflake FinOps\nContent:\nFinOps strategies have to continue to evolve alongside Snowflake.

For additional information, see [Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](limitations.html) .\n\nThis topic describes the costs associated with developing, publishing and using a\nSnowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. It contains information for both providers and consumers.\n\n## Costs to consumers [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nA Snowflake Native App may incur costs in the consumer account. The total cost of running\na Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services is determined by the following:\n\n* Costs determined by the provider\n* Infrastructure costs\n\n### Costs determined by the provider [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nA provider may monetize a Snowflake Native App using any of the [paid listing pricing models](../../collaboration/provider-becoming.html) that are available in the Snowflake Marketplace. These models include subscription based and usage based plans.\n\nThis cost to the consumer is determined by the provider. Consumers pay for provider software via the Snowflake Marketplace in addition to costs associated with running Snowflake\ninfrastructure, including warehouses and compute pools.\n\n### Infrastructure costs [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nAll infrastructure costs, including those related to compute pools, warehouse compute, storage, and\ndata transfer are the responsibility of the consumer of a Snowflake Native App.\n\nA consumer can use the IN ACCOUNT clause of the [SHOW COMPUTE POOLS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-compute-pools) command to see all compute pools in their account\nand the current state of the compute pool. Costs are not incurred when a compute pool is suspended.\n\nA Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services requires at least one compute pool and might require multiple compute pools to run as\nintended. A consumer has full control over the compute resources that the app requires, and may suspend a\ncompute pool or drop an application at any time.\n\nSeparate charges for compute pool compute related to the Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services appear on the customer billing\nstatement. A consumer can determine the compute pool billing charges for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services using the [ACCOUNT USAGE views](../snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) provided by\nSnowpark Container Services.\n\nFor more details, such as the consumption table for compute pools, contact your account representative.\n\n## Costs to providers [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nProviders can also incur costs when developing and maintaining a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services, including the\nfollowing:\n\n* Providers incur Snowpark Container Services compute costs associated with both initial development and\n  ongoing testing and support for their Snowflake Native App. The compute cost may be controlled through\n  orchestration of compute pools during provider-side development and testing.\n* The storage of container images can incur costs when a provider creates a new version or patch of\n  a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. In this context, the Docker images that the app requires are copied into an image\n  repository that is not directly accessible or observable by the provider or the consumer.\n  \n  Services in the consumer account are created from the versioned images that are stored in this\n  repository. Providers are responsible for the storage costs for the images in this stage, which\n  appear on their Snowflake bill. These costs are aggregated with other storage costs that their account incurs.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\n[Share your feedback](/feedback)\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\n[Privacy Notice](https://www.snowflake.com/privacy-policy/) [Site Terms](https://www.snowflake.com/legal/snowflake-site-terms/) Cookies Settings © 2026 Snowflake, Inc.

So why invest in a third-party Snowflake cost-management platform?\nHere’s what Snowflake natively provides:\n**Resource Monitors:** These let you set credit limits on warehouses or your entire account. You can configure them to watch credit usage and optionally suspend warehouses when usage hits a defined limit.\n**Budgets:** These let admins set monthly credit-spending limits and get alerts when projected spending is about to exceed. The spending limits can be set for your account or custom groups of objects.\nNow, let’s return to our question: why not use native Snowflake tools?\nThe problem is that these native tools operate more like safety nets than management or optimization engines.\nThey don’t help you understand why costs climbed. They can only inform you when spending has already reached a dangerous level.\nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > Can I just use Snowflake native cost tools?\nContent:\nTake Resource Monitors: they can tell you a warehouse exceeded its quota, but they can’t explain **why** . They don’t surface inefficient queries, runaway workloads, or which teams and users are driving the spike.\nSnowflake also doesn’t automatically map warehouse or query usage to business units, cost centers, or environments. This makes accurate cost allocation slow, manual, and often incomplete.\nIf you want to track Snowflake alongside the rest of your cloud ecosystem such as AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, or other SaaS data tools, native Snowflake features cannot provide unified visibility.\nFor organizations with multiple teams, fast-growing workloads, or high Snowflake usage, native tools cannot deliver the visibility, automation, or intelligence required to proactively manage spend.\nA third-party Snowflake cost management platform fills those gaps by offering:\n ... \nSection Title: Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools > ... > Check for customizable dashboards and reporting\nContent:\nIt’s very common for a platform’s default dashboards and reports to not fully meet your needs. So the tool you’re choosing should also let you build custom dashboards and reports based on your specific needs.\nDifferent teams care about different metrics, so a one-size-fits-all dashboard rarely works. Finance might want rolling cost projections, while engineering needs query-level drill-downs.\nCustom views let each group track what matters to them without clutter.

Its credit-based billing model is also directly recognized in the FOCUS specification, ensuring alignment with the industry’s standard for cloud cost and usage data. You can see the details of the FOCUS v1.2 spec [here](https://focus.finops.org/focus-specification/v1-2/) .\n*Note: At the time of writing, FOCUS v2.1 is the latest version. Snowflake mappings are still primarily aligned with v1.2, which means some newer dimensions (e.g., richer invoice identifiers, commitments) require external enrichment pipelines.*\n ... \nSection Title: ... > What is Possible in the Snowflake Portal\nContent:\nThe Snowflake web portal provides native visibility into cost and usage, enabling FinOps practices directly within the platform. From the Billing & Usage section, customers can download detailed usage statements that include credits consumed, billing currency, and invoiced amounts. These statements serve as the source of truth for financial reconciliation and can be mapped into the FOCUS specification for standardized reporting.\nIn addition, the portal exposes Snowsight dashboards for monitoring warehouse utilization, query activity, and service-level costs. Finance and engineering teams can leverage these dashboards to track trends, attribute spend, and spot anomalies without external tools. While deeper FinOps workflows may require exporting data to FOCUS-compliant pipelines, the portal ensures that organizations always have a clear, auditable view of Snowflake consumption and spend.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Why Build a Custom Cost Analytics App?\nContent:\nSnowflake’s native portal and Snowsight dashboards provide useful insights into usage, spend, and warehouse performance — great for quick checks and financial reconciliation. But when teams need interactive, FinOps-oriented analysis, a custom Streamlit app inside Snowflake delivers more. By combining live telemetry ( `ACCOUNT_USAGE` ) with pre-aggregated snapshots, applying cost-aware caching, and drilling into query-level cost drivers, the app goes beyond static reporting. It enforces permission checks, adds filters by service or warehouse, and surfaces the underlying SQL so Finance and Engineering share the same transparent view. In short, it transforms Snowflake telemetry into a collaborative cockpit for FinOps, aligning data with FOCUS dimensions and enabling actionable insights, accountability, and optimization at scale.\nDemo Environment:\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nDaily Trend\n ... \nSection Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake — Insights from a Streamlit App > Summary\nContent:\nSnowflake already gives organizations powerful cost visibility through its portal, usage views, and Snowsight dashboards. But for teams adopting FinOps at scale, native reporting is just the starting point. By aligning Snowflake’s credit-based model with the FOCUS specification, and extending telemetry with a custom Streamlit app, companies can bridge the gap between financial governance and engineering workflows.\nThe result: a collaborative, cost-aware cockpit that empowers Finance, Engineering, and Product teams to share the same transparent view of usage, detect cost drivers early, and keep cloud spending predictable without slowing innovation."]},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/2026/other/2026-02-01-organization-usage-new-views","title":"Feb 01, 2026: New ORGANIZATION_USAGE premium views | Snowflake Documentation","excerpts":["[DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.snowflake.com)\n\n/\n\n[Get started](/en/user-guide-getting-started)\n\n[Guides](/en/guides)\n\n[Developer](/en/developer)\n\n[Reference](/en/reference)\n\n[Release notes](/en/release-notes/overview)\n\n[Tutorials](/en/tutorials)\n\n[Status](https://status.snowflake.com)\n\n[Release notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Snowflake server release notes and feature updates](/en/release-notes/new-features) Feb 01, 2026 - New ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE premium views\n\n# Feb 01, 2026: New ORGANIZATION\\_ USAGE premium views [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nThe ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE schema now includes three new [premium views](../../../user-guide/organization-accounts-premium-views) that are available in the [organization account](../../../user-guide/organization-accounts) .
