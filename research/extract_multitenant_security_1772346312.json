Although  this  approach  allocates  individual  objects  to  tenants,  the\napplication  still  operates  within  a  single  Snowflake  account.\n\n\n●\nAccount  Per  Tenant  (APT):   APT   isolates  tenants  into  separate  Snowflake  accounts.  Unlike\nOPT,  each  tenant  within  the  application  has  its  own  dedicated  Snowflake  account.\n\n\nTenancy  models  have  different  advantages  regarding  security,  storage,  compute,  and  connectivity,\nand  a  hybrid  approach  may  be  needed  to  properly  address  these  considerations.  Hybrids  between\ntenancy  models  are  common.  For  example,  a  design  might  use  a  multi-tenant  table  to  consolidate\nstorage  but  allocate  dedicated  compute  resources  to  each  tenant,  thereby  forming  an  MTT/OPT\nhybrid  design.\n\n\nThis  white  paper  has  three  parts:\n\n\n●\nPart  One  helps  data  application  builders  understand  the  pros-and-cons  and\ncosts-and-benefits  of  the  various  patterns\n\n\n●\nPart  Two  describes  each  pattern  in  greater  detail  and  offers  guidance  on  the  Snowflake\nfeatures  required  for  proper  implementation\n\n\n●\nPart  Three  provides  additional  information  to  help  you  evaluate  tenancy  models  based  on\nsecurity,  storage,  and  compute  requirements\n\n\nPart  One:  Comparing  Multi-Tenant\nDesign  Patterns\n\n\nThis  section  compares  and  contrasts  the  three  patterns  and  describes  the  requirements  that  tend\nto  favor  one  design  approach  over  the  others.\n\n\nMulti-tenant  table  (MTT)\n\n\nMTT's  chief  characteristics  are  scalability   and  architectural  simplicity .\n\n\n●\nMTT  is  the  most  scalable  design  pattern  in  terms  of  the  number  of  tenants  an  application\ncan  support.  This  approach  supports  apps  with  millions  of  tenants.\n\n\nPage  2\n\n\n\n\n\n●\nIt  has  a  simpler  architecture  within  Snowflake.  Simplicity  matters  because  object\nproliferation  makes  managing  myriad  objects  increasingly  difficult  over  time.  With  MTT,\nadding  tenants  does  not  cause  the  number  of  objects  to  grow,  but  adding  tenants  to  OPT\nand  APT  can  result  in  hundreds  or  thousands  of  objects  being  created  within  Snowflake.\nFrom  a  cost  standpoint,  MTT  is  usually  more  cost-efficient  because  multiple  customers  utilize\nshared  compute  and  other  resources  more  efficiently.\n\n\nBut  MTT  has  a  somewhat  rigid  requirement:  To  use  MTT,  an  app's  data  model  has  to  have  the  same\ngeneral  shape  across  all  tenants.  Application  builders  can  achieve  slight  variances  using  custom\ncolumns  that  only  apply  to  certain  types  of  tenants,  but  this  approach  introduces  sparsity  into  the\ndata.\n\n\nObject  per  tenant  (OPT)\n\n\nOPT  is  a  great  fit  if  each  tenant  has  a  different  data  model.  Unlike  MTT,  the  tenant  data  shape  can\nbe  unique  for  each  tenant.  OPT  does  not  scale  as  easily  as  MTT,  however.  OPT  typically  scales  well\nfrom  tens  to  hundreds  of  tenants,  but  starts  to  become  unwieldy  when  it  includes  thousands  of\ntenant  databases.\n\n\nSecurity  can  factor  into  the   decision  to  use  an  OPT  design  pattern.  Some  customers  prefer  the\nOPT  model  because  they  don't  want  to  manage  an  entitlement  table,  secure  views,  or  row-level\nsecurity  with  strong  processes  behind  it.  They  are,  however,  comfortable  using  RBAC  to  control\nwho  has  specific  access  to  a  database.\n\n\nSome  apps  that  use  the  OPT  model  give  customers  their  own  dedicated  compute  resources  to\nsatisfy  contractual,  security,  or  regulatory  requirements.\n\n\nAccount  per  tenant  (APT)\n\n\nAPT  isolates  tenants  at  the  account  level.  Typically,  customers  have  a  strong  security  reason  for\nchoosing  this  approach.  For  example,  organizations  bound  by  strict  regulatory  mandates  may\nchoose  this  option  if:\n\n\n●\nThey  need  to  implement  a  dedicated  connection  string  per  tenant\n\n\n●\nThey  require  security  measures  such  as  Bring  Your  Own  Tool  (BYOT)\n\n\n●\nThey  want  to  use  per-tenant  IP  restrictions  at  the  account  level\n ... \nways  to  do  authentication,  but  the  following  principles  generally  apply:\n\n\n●\nApplication  users  authenticate  to  the  application  as  they  normally  would.\n\n\n●\nThere  is  typically  a  secrets  manager  at  the  application-tier  level  that  stores  credentials  for\nthe  corresponding  Snowflake  user.  The  application  is  programmed  to  obtain  a  Snowflake\nsession  using  one  of  several  supported  authentication  methods.\n\n\n●\nUsers  are  only  authorized  to  query  secure  views  and  are  only  authorized  to  see  their\ntenant  based  on  the  user/role  link  to  tenant_id .\n\n\nFigure  7  shows  an  application  that  establishes  a  Snowflake  session  based  on  a  secrets  manager\nlookup.  Note  that  the  application  manages  the  key-pair  user  authentication  flow  and  stores  the\nSnowflake  user  and  session  access  token.  Network  policies  control  access  to  Snowflake  from  the\napplication  tier  over  Private  Link,  which  is  optional.  And,  finally,  role-based  access  controls  (RBAC)\nroute  users  to  default  warehouses  and  databases,  and  allow  users  to  access  only  the  data  that  they\nare  permitted  to  see  within  the  application.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage  12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  7:   Obtaining  and  storing  a  user  session  via  key-pair  authentication\n\n\nIsolating  working  databases  if  needed\n\n\nIsolating  working  databases  is  optional.  Some  application  builders  directly  load  data  into  the\nserving  database  and  Snowflake  points  to  the  initial  landing  tables.  But  other  builders  need  to  run\ntransformations  in  Snowflake  before  serving  data,  in  which  case  a  best  practice  is  to  separate  the\nserving  database  from  the  working  databases  used  for  transformation  or  ingestion  from  outside\nsources.  The  application  can  be  configured  to  write  data  to  both  the  serving  database  or  the\nworking  databases  as  appropriate  for  the  application  functionality.\nSnowflake  recommends  separating  databases  to  simplify  application  administration.  For  example,\nit's  easier  to  configure  RBAC  to  control  \"what  should  be  done  where \"   and  \"who  has  access  to\nwhat \"   if  databases  are  separate.\n\n\nRegarding  workload  processing,  you  can  do  some  of  these  processes  offline  if  that  makes  sense  for\nthe  application,  and  then  apply  them  to  the  serving  database  as  appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage  13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  8:  Separate  the  working  databases  used  for  transformation  or  ingestion  from  the  service\ndatabase  as  needed  for  your  application.\n\n\nIsolating  workloads  as  needed  or  pooling  to  save  costs\n\n\nSimilar  to  database  separation  being  a  general  best  practice,  workload  separation  based  on  the\ntype  of  workload  is  a  good  idea.  Specific  recommendations  include:\n\n\n●\nGive  developers  their  own  warehouse  for  development  work\n\n\n●\nPool  application  users  on  a  common  multi-cluster  warehouse  or  isolate  them  onto\ndedicated  warehouses  based  on  application  requirements\n\n\n●\nUse  different  warehouses  for  different  application  purposes\n\n\n●\nIsolate  other  workloads  to  their  own  warehouses\n\n\nWhen  it  comes  to  tenants,  app  builders  need  to  make  decisions  around  whether  to  give  tenants  a\ndedicated  warehouse,  versus  pooling  them  on  common  warehouses  or  multi-cluster  warehouses.\nCost  will  be  a  factor.  You  can  pool  dashboard  queries  more  easily  than  ad  hoc  queries  because\nthey're  predictable.  Ad  hoc  usage  can  introduce  unexpected  and  unplanned  expenses.  Strict  COGS\nper  tenant  calculations  are  a  reason  to  separate  tenants  into  dedicated  warehouses  because\npooled  heuristics  are  less  precise.  Some  applications  pool  users  by  default  but  offer  the  option  to\npay  extra  to  get  a  dedicated  warehouse.\n\n\nPage  14\nFigure  9:   Separating  workloads  based  on  the  type  of  workload  is  a  best  practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nRouting  users  to  warehouses\n\n\nTo  make  application  management  easier,  it's  essential  to  configure  RBAC  and  default  warehouses\nin  Snowflake  to  route  users  to  the  correct  warehouses.  Proper  planning  and  up  front  configuration\nwill  ensure  that  user  lookups  within  the  secrets  manager  and  the  application  tier  will\nautomatically  route  the  user  to  the  right  database  and  the  right  warehouse.\n\n\nThe  following  guidance  applies  to  routing  users:\n\n\n●\nYou  can  grant  roles  the  privilege  to  operate  (modify)  or  use  (run  queries  against)  a  given\nwarehouse\n\n\n●\nUsers  can  be  configured  to  use  a  specific  warehouse  by  default,  but  roles  cannot\n\n\n●\nUsers  with  access  to  multiple  warehouses  can  choose  to  use  a  warehouse  upon\nestablishing  a  session  or  before  query  execution\n\n\n\n\n\nPage  15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  10:   Configuring  RBAC  and  default  warehouses  in  Snowflake  makes  managing  the  application\ntier  easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage  16\n\n\n\n\n\nOPT  design  notes\n\n\nOPT  enables  you  to  isolate  tenant  data  by  database,  schema,  and  table,  and  use  RBAC  to  control\nwhich  user  or  role  can  see  or  query  an  object.  Separating  customers  into  their  own  databases  is\nthe  most  common  practice  (see  Figure  11),  because  it  is  the  easiest,  cleanest  isolation  level,  but\nsome  app  builders  separate  customers  into  dedicated  tables,  for  example,  in  embedded  analytics\nuse  cases  in  which  data  applications  create  a  report  table  per  tenant.\n\nWhich  objects  to  use  for  isolation  depends  on  factors  such  as  your  data  pipeline  design,  your\nsoftware  development  life  cycle  process,  the  consistency  of  your  data  shape,  and  more.  How  many\n ... \ncertain  tenant  slices  from  a  multi-tenant  database  somewhere  else.  While  it's  possible  to  replicate\nan  entire  multi-tenant  table  to  all  clouds  and  regions  where  it's  required,  over  time  this  design  will\nbecome  unmanageable  as  data  sizes  and  the  number  of  tenants  grow.  For  example,  Figure  15\nshows  a  multi-tenant,  multi-CSP  app  design.  Customer  D  shares  data  on  GCP,  but  it  does  not  make\nsense  to  replicate  Customer  D's  data  on  Azure  if  no  one  accesses  it  there.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage  20\n\n\nNote :  If  you  have  a  data  sharing  use  case,  consider  using  Snowflake  Data  Marketplace  to  take\nadvantage  of  the  latest  features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  15:   If  you  do  not  want  to  replicate  all  tenant  data  to  all  cloud/region  pairs,  consider\nincorporating  OPT  into  your  MTT  design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage  21\n\n\n\n\n\nAPT  design  notes\n\n\nWith  the  APT  model,  there  is  typically  one  Snowflake  account,  one  warehouse,  and  one  database\nper  tenant.\n\n\nThere  can  be  exceptions.  For  example:\n\n\n●\nMultiple  tenants  can  share  an  account  to  form  a  hybrid  of  APT  and  MTT  (see  Figure  16).\n\n\n●\nThere  might  be  an  additional  administrative  warehouse  for  data  loading  or  administrative\nactivities,  depending  on  whether  the  data  is  going  out  to  the  account  through  data  sharing,\nor  if  some  form  of  ETL  or  ELT  is  used  to  do  additional  processing  within  the  tenant  account.\nFor  example,  some  applications  load  the  data  and  don't  need  to  do  anything  further  in  the\ntenant  account  because  it's  done  elsewhere.\n\n\n●\nMany  APT  designs  can  rely  on  single-cluster  warehouses.  A  heavily  used  application  may\nrequire  many  clusters,  including  multi-cluster  warehouses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  16:   Multiple  tenants  can  share  an  account  to  form  a  hybrid  of  APT  and  MTT.\n\n\nPage  22\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthenticating\nWith  APT,  authenticating  via  the  application  tier  largely  works  the  same  as  with  MTT  and  OPT.\nThe  key  difference  is  that  the  account  URL  changes  per  tenant.  It's  also  possible  for  users  to  log  in\nto  their  Snowflake  account  directly,  either  through  the  UI  or  a  BYOT  solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  17:   Sometimes  data  application  builders  decide  not  to  authenticate  users  in  the  application\ntier  and  instead  require  users  to  log  in  to  their  Snowflake  accounts  directly,  either  through  the  UI  or  a\nBYOT   solution.\n\n\n\n\nPage  23\n\n\n\n\n\nIngesting  and  transforming  data\n\n\nAs  mentioned  previously,  applications  typically  use  a  central  account  to  manage  the  working\ndatabases  used  for  ingestion  from  outside  sources  or  transformation.\n\n\nYou  can  share  tenant  data  with  tenant  accounts  using  Snowflake  Secure  Data  Sharing.  This  can\nalso  be  done  with  an  MTT  or  OPT  approach.\n\n\nYou  could  also  use  ELT  or  Snowflake  replication  to  materialize  data  in  the  tenant  accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  18:   Data  can  pass  to  the  account  through  an  ETL/ELT  process,  or  through  Secure  Data\nSharing  in  which  the  data  is  directly  loaded  into  the  accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage  24\n\n\n\n\n\nPart  Three:  Evaluating  Tenancy  Models\n\n\nYou  should  evaluate  all  three  tenancy  models,  but  Snowflake  recommends  starting  with  the  MTT\npattern.  It's  generally  instructive  to  first  evaluate  if  the  MTT  pattern  will  work—and,  if  not,  why.\n\n\nStorage  and  security  considerations\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  19:  Flowchart  for  evaluating  storage  and  security  requirements.  OPT  here  refers  to\ndatabases,  schemas,  and  tables  (not  virtual  warehouses  and  compute).\n\n\nDecisions  hinge  on:\n\n\n●\nContractual  obligations  that  dictate  how  data  should  be  stored  and  encrypted\n\n\n●\nRegulatory  obligations  that  dictate  how  data  should  be  stored  and  encrypted\n\n\n●\nInfoSec  standards  on  how  data  should  be  stored  and  encrypted\n\n\n●\nApplication  owner's  perspective  on  the  enforcement  of  database  RBAC\n\n\n●\nApplication  owner's  perspective  on  the  enforcement  of  row-level  security  through\nentitlement  tables  and  views\n\n\n●\nHow  customers  access  the  application:\n\n○\nThrough  an  application  UI?\n\n\n○\nThrough  the  Snowflake  UI?\n\n\n○\nThrough  a  BYOT  solution?\n\n\n●\nHow  consistent  data  shapes  (data  models)  are  across  customers\n\n\nPage  25\n\n\n\n\n\nEncryption,  isolation,  and  data  protection  considerations\n\n\n●\nTri-secret  Secure  (Bring  Your  Own  Key)  is  available  at  only  the  account  level  in  Snowflake.\n\n\n●\nSnowflake  uses  a  hierarchy  of  encryption  keys  at  the  account,  table,  and  file  level  to\nencrypt  data-at-rest  and  prevent  data  from  being  accessed  between  accounts  (except  data\nsharing).\n\n\n●\nSnowflake  is  a  multi-tenant  service,  and  the  cloud  object  store  is  a  multi-tenant  service,  so\ndata  is  not  truly  isolated  at  the  public  cloud  level,  but  encryption  creates  the  isolation.\n\n\n●\nDatabases  and  schemas  are  largely  logical  constructs;  they  don’t  physically  separate  data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure  20:  Flowchart  for  evaluating  compute  and  security  requirements.  OPT  means  one  virtual\nwarehouse  per  tenant  where  MTT  refers  to  tenants  on  a  pooled  virtual  warehouse.\n\n\nDecisions  hinge  on:\n\n\n●\nContractual  obligations  that  dictate  how  tenants  should  be  isolated  on  raw  compute.\n\n\n●\nRegulatory  obligations  that  dictate  how  tenants  should  be  isolated  on  raw  compute.\n\n\n●\nInfoSec  standards  on  how  tenants  should  be  isolated  on  raw  compute.\n\n\n●\nNetwork  policy  requirements.  Will  user-based  network  policies  work?  Or  do  you  have\nmore  complex  requirements  that  require  account-based  policies?\n\n\n●\nIf  virtual  warehouse  cache  constitutes  data  that  must  be  isolated.\n\n\n●\nHow  COGS  are  managed  per  tenant  or  billed  back  to  the  customer.\n\n\n\n(Calculating  COGS  per  tenant  is  more  straightforward  when  each  tenant  has  its  own\ncompute  resources.  If  tenants  share  compute  resources,  you  can  use  a  heuristic  to\n\nPage  26\n\n\n\n\n\ncalculate  COGS  per  tenant,  but  it's  not  as  precise.  Some  apps  need  the  precision,  and  some\nare  fine  with  a  reasonable  approximation.)\n\n\n●\nHow  customers  access  the  application:\n\n○\nThrough  an  application  UI?\n\n\n○\nThrough  the  Snowflake  UI?\n\n\n○\nThrough  a  BYOT  solution?\n\n\n●\nHow  many  tenants  could  use  a  single  virtual  warehouse  concurrently.\n\n\nBilling,  resource  utilization,  and  network  policy  considerations\n\n\n●\nSnowflake  network  policies  (IP  allow  lists)  can  be  applied  only  at  the  account  or  user  level.\n\n\n●\nSnowflake  virtual  warehouses  cache  data  from  object  stores  temporarily  for  whole  or\npartial  reuse  in  subsequent  queries.  RBAC  and  secure  view  rules  still  apply.\n\n\n●\nSnowflake  compute  billing  is  done  at  the  virtual  warehouse  level.  Calculating  per-query,\nper-user,  or  per-tenant  costs  can  be  inexact  if  tenants  share  compute.\n\n\n●\nSnowflake  virtual  warehouses  do  not  allow  for  resource  limits  per  user  or  per  tenant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout  Snowflake\n\n\nSnowflake  delivers  the  Data  Cloud—a  global  network  where  thousands  of  organizations  mobilize\ndata  with  near-unlimited  scale,  concurrency,  and  performance.  Inside  the  Data  Cloud,\norganizations  unite  their  siloed  data,  easily  discover  and  securely  share  governed  data,  and\nexecute  diverse  analytic  workloads.

For additional information, see Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions .\nThis topic describes the security requirements and best practices that providers must\nfollow when developing a Snowflake Native App. All apps that meet the conditions described in Automated security reviews must conform to the security requirements\noutlined in the following sections:\nSecurity requirements for application code\nSecurity requirements for app functionality\nSecurity requirements for app permissions\nNote\nSecurity requirements are subject to change as Snowflake continues to monitor new potential risks.\nSection Title: ... > Security requirements for application code ¶\nContent:\nApp code included within an application package must conform to the following security requirements:\nYour app must not load or execute any code from outside the application package except\nSnowflake-provided libraries. All the app code, including all library dependencies and setup code,\nmust be included in the app version defined in the application package.\nAll app code must be un-obfuscated, meaning that the code must be human readable. This requirement\nincludes minified JavaScript code.NoteIf an app needs to use minified JavaScript code, it must include a corresponding source map file\nthat can be used to recover the un-minified code.\nAll dependencies or libraries with critical or high common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) must be\nupdated to a secure version, if available.\nSection Title: ... > Security requirements for app functionality ¶\nContent:\nThe following security requirements apply to the functionality of your app:\nSection Title: ... > Security requirements for app functionality ¶\nContent:\nAll apps must provide the following information to customers as part of a listing:\nAll app functionality and features. All Internet endpoints and URLs that the app connects to. All external functions in the app. Any consumer data logged, collected, or stored by the app. Apps should prohibit all non-essential cookies. Apps should communicate all essential cookies to consumers\nApps should function as advertised in the app listing. All app installation and setup instructions must be included in the app listing. Apps must not store or require any plain text customer secrets. Any communication between the app and the Internet should be over an HTTPS connection with a valid\nTLS certificate. Apps must not have any functionality that could result in harm to Snowflake, its customers, or third\nparties.\nSection Title: ... > Security requirements for app functionality ¶\nContent:\nHarm includes but is not limited to:\nData leakage and/or loss;\nRestricting consumer access to their data unless explicitly designed as part of the app\nfunctionality, for example, data masking for data access policies. Excessive resource consumption. Arbitrary code injection/execution. All connections to an app, including web-based user interfaces and APIs, must first authenticate using a\nSnowflake-provided method of authentication. Any app-specific authentication must be presented to users\nafter Snowflake authentication has succeeded. Apps should not create any public endpoints that allow connections to the app without a successful\nauthentication through Snowflake first.\nSection Title: ... > Security requirements for app permissions ¶\nContent:\nThe following security requirements apply to the privileges set by your app:\nAll apps must provide the following information in the manifest file:\nAll privileges required by the app on all objects.\nAll API integrations.\nApps should only ask for the minimum set of privileges needed for the app to function.\nSection Title: ... > Recommended security best practices ¶\nContent:\nIn addition to the security requirements imposed by the automated security scan, Snowflake recommends the\nfollowing best practices when developing a Snowflake Native App. Following these best practices helps reduce\nthe likelihood of an app being blocked during security review.\nFollow secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices.\nReview app code for vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle and fix them before creating\nan app version.\nReview third-party libraries for vulnerabilities and update them to the latest secure version.\nReview and update all third-party libraries in the app at least once a quarter.\nFollow Snowflake security best practices as described in the following:\nSecurity Practices for UDFs and Procedures\nSecuring an external function\nSection Title: ... > Recommended security best practices for an app with containers ¶\nContent:\nIn addition to the security best practices for a core Snowflake Native App outlined in Recommended security best practices , the following\nsecurity best practices apply to an app with containers:\nSection Title: ... > Recommended security best practices for an app with containers ¶\nContent:\nLimit the use of external dependencies and libraries to minimize the attack surface of an app and\nreduce the risk of supply chain vulnerabilities. Follow container image hardening requirements, such as the use of minimal base images, removal of\nunnecessary packages, and secure configuration of runtime environments. Use secure communication protocols and encryption for all inter-container and external communication. Generate comprehensive logging and auditing of container activities and data access patterns. Update and patch container images regularly to address known vulnerabilities and security issues. Implement only required privileges to minimizing the attack surface of containerized apps. Managing secrets and sensitive data securely, using appropriate encryption and access controls. Conduct thorough security testing and vulnerability assessments before submitting apps for review.\nSection Title: ... > Recommended security best practices for an app with containers ¶\nContent:\nRespond promptly to security incidents and collaborate with Snowflake during incident response. Provide clear and accurate documentation of app functionality, dependencies, and security controls. Educate and guide consumers on the secure use and configuration of their apps.\nSection Title: ... > Best practices for developing and publishing an application package ¶\nContent:\nTo streamline the development and publishing process for a Snowflake Native App, Snowflake recommends creating\ntwo separate application packages:\nSection Title: ... > Best practices for developing and publishing an application package ¶\nContent:\nDevelopment application packageThe development application package is intended for rapid iteration and testing purposes. It should\nhave its DISTRIBUTION property set to `INTERNAL` . This ensures that the application package remains\ninternal and is not distributed to external consumers or to Snowflake scanning and approval.By keeping this package separate from the production package, developers can quickly make changes and\ntest new features without triggering the security review process for each iteration. Production application packageThe production application package is intended for publishing an application package and distributing it\nto Snowflake for scanning and approval and to external consumers.\nSection Title: ... > Best practices for developing and publishing an application package ¶\nContent:\nThe production application package should have\nits DISTRIBUTION property set to `EXTERNAL` .Only versions that have passed the provider’s security review should be added to this package, ensuring\nthat the app meets the required security standards before being made available to consumers.\nSection Title: ... > Best practices for developing and publishing an application package ¶\nContent:\nBy following the best practice of having separate development and production packages, developers can maintain an efficient\ndevelopment lifecycle while ensuring that only secure and approved versions of the app are published and\ndistributed to external consumers.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes No\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\nShare your feedback\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\nOn this page\nSecurity requirements for application code\nSecurity requirements for app functionality\nSecurity requirements for app permissions\nRecommended security best practices\nRecommended security best practices for an app with containers\nBest practices for developing and publishing an application package\nRelated content\nSection Title: ... > Best practices for developing and publishing an application package ¶\nContent:\nSecurity requirements and guidelines for a Snowflake Native App\nRun the automated security scan\nSection Title: Security requirements and best practices for a Snowflake Native App ¶ > Privacy Preference Center\nContent:\nYour Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored\nYour Privacy\nStrictly Necessary Cookies\nPerformance Cookies\nFunctional Cookies\nTargeting Cookies\nSection Title: Security requirements and best practices for a Snowflake Native App ¶ > ... > Your Privacy\nContent:\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
