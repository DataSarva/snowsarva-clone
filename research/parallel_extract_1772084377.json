As organizations scale across multiple clouds and SaaS providers, the challenge isn’t simply “how much are we spending?” but rather “are we spending in the right places, at the right time, for the right outcomes?”\n\nThis is where FinOps comes in: a practice that blends finance, engineering, and product disciplines to create shared accountability for cloud spending. And Snowflake is not just another platform in this story — it’s a proving ground for how FinOps can be embedded directly into daily workflows. By surfacing cost data natively and aligning with open standards like FOCUS, Snowflake helps teams turn raw credit consumption into meaningful business insights.\n\nIn this post, we’ll explore how you can stand up a cost analytics dashboard in minutes, map Snowflake usage data to FinOps practices, and bridge the gap between strategic governance and hands-on engineering. Think of this as your playbook for making Snowflake not only performant, but also financially accountable.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis post covers how to:\n\n* Deploy a cost analytics dashboard in Snowflake using Streamlit.\n* Analyze credits by service and warehouse.\n* Track usage trends over time.\n* Drill into query-level cost drivers.\n* Apply a cost-aware design (snapshots + caching) to minimize overhead.\n* Start with a minimal role & app, then expand to org-level views for company-wide FinOps visibility.\n\nDemo Full Detail of Costs:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nDaily Trend Press enter or click to view image in full size\n\nDashboard\n\n## Why FinOps Matters\n\nMost cloud providers actively support FinOps practices through the [FinOps Foundation](http://www.finops.org) , helping customers optimize their cloud bills in line with open standards like FOCUS. The FOCUS specification is an open schema maintained by the Foundation where providers and vendors can map their cost and usage data to a consistent model. This makes it easier for enterprises to aggregate, analyze, and act on cost data across multi-cloud and SaaS ecosystems.\n\nIn the case of Snowflake, it provides native transparency through `ACCOUNT_USAGE` and `ORGANIZATION_USAGE` views, giving teams near real-time insights into where credits are being consumed—whether in warehouses, queries, or storage. Its credit-based billing model is also directly recognized in the FOCUS specification, ensuring alignment with the industry’s standard for cloud cost and usage data. You can see the details of the FOCUS v1.2 spec [here](https://focus.finops.org/focus-specification/v1-2/) .\n\n> _Note: At the time of writing, FOCUS v2.1 is the latest version. Snowflake mappings are still primarily aligned with v1.2, which means some newer dimensions (e.g., richer invoice identifiers, commitments) require external enrichment pipelines._\n> \n> \n\n## How Snowflake Maps Its Cost Data Model to FOCUS v1.2\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nFOCUS in Snowflake\n\n## What is Possible in the Snowflake Portal\n\nThe Snowflake web portal provides native visibility into cost and usage, enabling FinOps practices directly within the platform. From the Billing & Usage section, customers can download detailed usage statements that include credits consumed, billing currency, and invoiced amounts. These statements serve as the source of truth for financial reconciliation and can be mapped into the FOCUS specification for standardized reporting.\n\nIn addition, the portal exposes Snowsight dashboards for monitoring warehouse utilization, query activity, and service-level costs. Finance and engineering teams can leverage these dashboards to track trends, attribute spend, and spot anomalies without external tools. While deeper FinOps workflows may require exporting data to FOCUS-compliant pipelines, the portal ensures that organizations always have a clear, auditable view of Snowflake consumption and spend.\n\n## Common Metrics Often Analyzed in Snowflake Portal\n\n* **Monthly Usage Statements & Billing Reconciliation  \n  ** Snowflake allows downloading [monthly usage statements](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/billing-usage-statement) that detail credits consumed and costs in currency. These are used to reconcile what appears in usage views with the official invoice.\n* **Overall Cost & Spend Breakdown (Account / Organization Level)  \n  ** Views like [Organization Overview and Account Overview](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) provide spend history, capacity contract consumption, and which accounts, warehouses, or services are driving the most cost.\n* **Warehouse Compute & Credit Utilization Metrics  \n  ** Metrics for warehouse usage (credits consumed by compute), load, latency, utilization vs capacity, and queued queries help optimize sizing, avoid spikes, and tune auto-resume/suspend policies. See the official [Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and [Datadog’s Snowflake metrics guide](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/snowflake-metrics) .\n* **Storage & Data Usage Metrics  \n  ** [Storage metrics](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com) include costs tied to staging, Time Travel retention, table sizes, and stage usage. These help identify underutilized storage and fine-tune retention policies.\n\n## Why Build a Custom Cost Analytics App?\n\nSnowflake’s native portal and Snowsight dashboards provide useful insights into usage, spend, and warehouse performance — great for quick checks and financial reconciliation. But when teams need interactive, FinOps-oriented analysis, a custom Streamlit app inside Snowflake delivers more. By combining live telemetry ( `ACCOUNT_USAGE` ) with pre-aggregated snapshots, applying cost-aware caching, and drilling into query-level cost drivers, the app goes beyond static reporting. It enforces permission checks, adds filters by service or warehouse, and surfaces the underlying SQL so Finance and Engineering share the same transparent view. In short, it transforms Snowflake telemetry into a collaborative cockpit for FinOps, aligning data with FOCUS dimensions and enabling actionable insights, accountability, and optimization at scale.\n\nDemo Environment:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nDaily Trend\n\n## A Few Useful Query Patterns\n\n```\n-- Daily credits used by warehouse  \nSELECT  \n  WAREHOUSE_NAME,  \n  TO_DATE(START_TIME) AS USAGE_DATE,  \n  ROUND(SUM(CREDITS_USED), 3) AS WH_CREDITS  \nFROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  \nWHERE START_TIME >= '2025-08-29' AND START_TIME < '2025-08-30'  \n  --AND WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'MY_WH'  \nGROUP BY 1,2  \nORDER BY 2,1;\n```\n\n```\n-- Daily credits used across all warehouses  \nSELECT TO_DATE(START_TIME) AS USAGE_DATE, SUM(CREDITS_USED) AS DAILY_CREDITS  \nFROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  \nWHERE START_TIME >= '2025-08-29' AND START_TIME < '2025-08-30'  \nGROUP BY USAGE_DATE  \nORDER BY USAGE_DATE;\n```\n\n```\n--    ESTIMATE WAREHOUSE CREDITS PER QUERY  \n--    Idea: allocate the warehouse daily credits proportionally  \n--    to each query's execution time (approximation).  \n--    LIMITATIONS: ignores overlaps/concurrency, multi-cluster scaling,  \n--    idle periods, result cache, etc.  \nWITH q AS (  \n  SELECT  \n    QUERY_ID,  \n    USER_NAME,  \n    WAREHOUSE_NAME,  \n    TO_DATE(START_TIME) AS USAGE_DATE,  \n    DATEDIFF('second', START_TIME, END_TIME) AS EXEC_SECONDS,  \n    CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES  \n  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY  \n  WHERE START_TIME >= '2025-08-29' AND START_TIME < '2025-08-30'  \n    AND WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'MY_WH'  \n    AND USER_NAME = 'USERNAME'  \n    AND EXECUTION_STATUS = 'SUCCESS'  \n),  \nagg_wh_day AS (  \n  SELECT  \n    WAREHOUSE_NAME,  \n    TO_DATE(START_TIME) AS USAGE_DATE,  \n    SUM(CREDITS_USED) AS WH_CREDITS_DAY  \n  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  \n  WHERE START_TIME >= '2025-08-29' AND START_TIME < '2025-08-30'  \n    AND WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'MY_WH'  \n  GROUP BY 1,2  \n),  \nagg_q_day AS (  \n  SELECT  \n    WAREHOUSE_NAME,  \n    USAGE_DATE,  \n    SUM(GREATEST(EXEC_SECONDS,0)) AS TOTAL_EXEC_SECONDS_DAY  \n  FROM q  \n  GROUP BY 1,2  \n)  \nSELECT  \n  q.QUERY_ID,  \n  q.USER_NAME,  \n  q.WAREHOUSE_NAME,  \n  q.USAGE_DATE,  \n  q.EXEC_SECONDS,  \n  -- Estimated warehouse credits allocated to the query  \n  ROUND(  \n    (q.EXEC_SECONDS / NULLIF(aqd.TOTAL_EXEC_SECONDS_DAY,0)) * awd.WH_CREDITS_DAY  \n  , 4) AS EST_WH_CREDITS,  \n  -- Actual cloud services credits per query (from QUERY_HISTORY)  \n  ROUND(q.CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES, 4) AS CREDITS_CLOUD_SERVICES,  \n  -- Estimated total per query (estimated compute + actual cloud services)  \n  ROUND(  \n    COALESCE((q.EXEC_SECONDS / NULLIF(aqd.TOTAL_EXEC_SECONDS_DAY,0)) * awd.WH_CREDITS_DAY, 0)  \n    + COALESCE(q.CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES, 0)  \n  , 4) AS EST_TOTAL_CREDITS  \nFROM q  \nJOIN agg_q_day aqd  \n  ON q.WAREHOUSE_NAME = aqd.WAREHOUSE_NAME  \n AND q.USAGE_DATE    = aqd.USAGE_DATE  \nJOIN agg_wh_day awd  \n  ON q.WAREHOUSE_NAME = awd.WAREHOUSE_NAME  \n AND q.USAGE_DATE    = awd.USAGE_DATE  \nORDER BY q.USAGE_DATE DESC, EST_TOTAL_CREDITS DESC;\n```\n\nIn the further reading section, you can find links to more detailed articles on Snowflake cost analysis, warehouse optimization, and storage management.\n\n## 📸 Screen Captures & Use Case\n\nThe following screenshots show how the Snowflake Cost Management Streamlit App supports interactive FinOps analysis:\n\n### 1\\.

Make sure to replace `<DB>` , `<SCHEMA>` , `<APP_NAME>` , and `<repo_path>` with your actual database name, schema name, desired app name, and the path to your repository containing the `costs_dashboard.py` file.\n\n```\n-- Run as ACCOUNTADMIN  \nCREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS COSTS_ROLE;  \nGRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE COSTS_ROLE;  \nGRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE MY_WH TO ROLE COSTS_ROLE;  \nGRANT CREATE STREAMLIT ON SCHEMA <DB>.<SCHEMA> TO ROLE COSTS_ROLE;  \nCREATE STREAMLIT <DB>.<SCHEMA>.<APP_NAME>  \n  FROM '<repo_path>'  \n  MAIN_FILE = '/costs_dashboard.py';  \nALTER STREAMLIT <DB>.<SCHEMA>.<APP_NAME> SET QUERY_WAREHOUSE = WH_XS_APP;\n```\n\n## Adding References to Non-Standard Libraries\n\nIf you want to use non-standard libraries (e.g., `plotly` ), you can create a custom environment file and attach it to the Streamlit app. Example `environment.yml` :\n\n```\nname: costs_analyzer_env  \nchannels:  \n  - snowflake  \ndependencies:  \n  - streamlit  \n  - plotly\n```\n\nThat is necessary if you want to use elements like pie chart from `plotly` :\n\n```\ndf_service[\"TOTAL_CREDITS\"] = (  \n    df_service[\"TOTAL_CREDITS\"].astype(float).round(2)  \n)  \ntotal_service = df_service[\"TOTAL_CREDITS\"].sum()  \nif total_service and total_service > 0:  \n    df_service[\"PERCENTAGE\"] = (  \n        df_service[\"TOTAL_CREDITS\"] / total_service * 100  \n    ).round(2)  \nst.plotly_chart(  \n    {  \n        \"data\": [  \n            {  \n                \"type\": \"pie\",  \n                \"labels\": df_service[\"SERVICE_TYPE\"],  \n                \"values\": df_service[\"TOTAL_CREDITS\"],  \n                \"hole\": 0.3,  \n            }  \n        ],  \n        \"layout\": {  \n            \"title\": \"Credits by Service Type (Pie Chart)\"  \n        }  \n    }  \n)\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nSnowflake already gives organizations powerful cost visibility through its portal, usage views, and Snowsight dashboards. But for teams adopting FinOps at scale, native reporting is just the starting point. By aligning Snowflake’s credit-based model with the FOCUS specification, and extending telemetry with a custom Streamlit app, companies can bridge the gap between financial governance and engineering workflows.\n\nThe result: a collaborative, cost-aware cockpit that empowers Finance, Engineering, and Product teams to share the same transparent view of usage, detect cost drivers early, and keep cloud spending predictable without slowing innovation.\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n1.

For additional information, see Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions .\n\nWhen you use Custom Event Billing for a Snowflake Native App, you can charge for specific types of application usage in addition to the existing\nusage-based pricing plans. To set it up, you must perform two high-level steps:\n\n1. Set up your application package to emit billable events by following the steps in this topic.\n2. Select a usage-based pricing plan with billable events for the listing you use to publish your Snowflake Native App to consumers.\n\nThis topic describes how to set up your application package to emit billable events using the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT and SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENTS system functions.\n\n## Overview of billable events in an application package ¶\n\nYou can set up your application package to emit billable events in response to specific usage events so that you can charge consumers based on\nhow much they use your Snowflake Native App.\n\nFor example, you can add a billable event to charge a consumer a specific amount for each call to a stored procedure in your Snowflake Native App.\n\nTo add billable events to an application package, do the following:\n\n1. Create stored procedures to define which usage events trigger calls to the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT and SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENTS system functions.\n   \n   Note\n   \n   You cannot test the output of the system function at this stage. This system function can only be called from a Snowflake Native App\n   installed in a consumer account.\n2. Add those stored procedures to the setup script of the application package.\n\nImportant\n\nSnowflake supports billable events that are emitted by calling the system function within a stored procedure in the application,\nas outlined by the examples in this topic.\n\nSnowflake does not support other methods of calculating the base charge for billable events, such as methods that use the output of a\ntable or user-defined function that outputs consumer activity or methods that use telemetry logged in an event table.\n\nIf you’re uncertain whether a proposed implementation will be supported, contact your Snowflake account representative.\n\n## Billable event examples ¶\n\nThe examples in this section show how to create stored procedures to emit billable events for common billing\nscenarios. Each of these examples calls the `createBillingEvent` function.\n\n### Call the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_ BILLING\\_ EVENT system function ¶\n\nThe following example shows how to create a wrapper function in a stored procedure to call the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function.\n\nNote\n\nYou can call this system function in a stored procedure written in JavaScript, Python, or Java.\n\nThis example creates a JavaScript stored procedure named `custom_event_billing` in the schema version that is accessible to the procedures that emit billing. The stored procedure creates a helper function called `createBillingEvent` which takes arguments that correspond to the typed parameters expected by the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function.\n\nFor more details about the parameters and the required types, see SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT .\n\n```\n CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE < schema_name >. custom_event_billing () \n RETURNS NULL \n LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT \n AS \n $$ \n /** \n    * Helper method to add a billable event \n    * Format timestamps as Unix timestamps in milliseconds \n    */ \n\n function createBillingEvent ( className , subclassName , startTimestampVal , timestampVal , baseCharge , objects , additionalInfo ) { \n try { \n var res = snowflake . createStatement ({ \n sqlText : `SELECT SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENT(' ${ className } ', \n                                                      ' ${ subclassName } ', \n ${ startTimestampVal } , \n ${ timestampVal } , \n ${ baseCharge } , \n                                                      ' ${ objects } ', \n                                                      ' ${ additionalInfo } ')` \n }). execute (); \n\n res . next (); \n\n return res . getColumnValue ( 1 ); \n } catch ( err ) { \n return err . message ; \n } \n } \n $$;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThe examples in this topic call this helper function.\n\n### Batch multiple billing events with the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_ BILLING\\_ EVENTS system function ¶\n\nThe following example stored procedure shows how to batch multiple Snowflake Native App billing events with the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENTS system function. By using batches, you save time, reduce the likelihood of exceeding call limits, and ensure your billing events are set up correctly.\n\nFor more details about the parameters and the required types, see SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENTS .\n\n```\n CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE < app_provider_db_1 >< app_provider_schema_1 >. external_proc_batch () \n RETURNS STRING \n LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT \n EXECUTE AS OWNER \n AS \n $$ \n function createBillingEventsBulk ( events ) { \n try { \n var res = snowflake . execute ({ \n sqlText : `call SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENTS(' ${ events } ')` \n });

\n $$;\n```\n\nCopy\n\n### Example: Billing based on calls to a stored procedure ¶\n\nThe following example shows how to create a stored procedure to emit a billable event when a consumer calls\nthat stored procedure in a Snowflake Native App.\n\nAdd this example code to your setup script in the same stored procedure that defines the helper function:\n\n```\n... \n // \n // Send a billable event when a stored procedure is called. \n // \n var event_ts = Date . now (); \n var billing_quantity = 1.0 ; \n var base_charge = billing_quantity ; \n var objects = \"[ \\\"db_1.public.procedure_1\\\" ]\" ; \n var retVal = createBillingEvent ( \"PROCEDURE_CALL\" , \"\" , event_ts , event_ts , base_charge , objects , \"\" ); \n // Run the rest of the procedure ... \n $$;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThis example code creates a stored procedure that calls the `createBillingEvent` function to emit a billable event\nwith the class name `PROCEDURE_CALL` and a base charge of `1.0` .\n\nNote\n\nThe types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters\nexpected by the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function.\n\n### Example: Billing based on rows consumed by a Snowflake Native App ¶\n\nThe following example shows how to create a stored procedure to emit a billable event based on the number of\nrows consumed within a table in the consumer account.\n\nAdd this example code to your setup script in the same stored procedure that defines the helper function:\n\n```\n... \n // Run a query and get the number of rows in the result \n var select_query = \"select i from db_1.public.t1\" ; \n res = snowflake . execute ({ sqlText : select_query }); \n res . next (); \n // \n // Send a billable event for rows returned from the select query \n // \n var event_ts = Date . now (); \n var billing_quantity = 2.5 ; \n var base_charge = res . getRowcount () * billing_quantity ; \n var objects = \"[ \\\"db_1.public.t1\\\" ]\" ; \n createBillingEvent ( \"ROWS_CONSUMED\" , \"\" , event_ts , event_ts , base_charge , objects , \"\" ); \n // Run the rest of the procedure ... \n $$;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThis example code creates a stored procedure that calls the `createBillingEvent` function to emit a billable event\nwith the class name `ROWS_CONSUMED` and a calculated base charge of `2.5` multiplied by the number of rows in the `db_1.public.t1` table in the consumer account.\n\nNote\n\nThe types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters\nexpected by the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function.\n\n### Example: Billing based on the number of rows ingested ¶\n\nThe following example shows how to create a stored procedure to emit a billable event based on the number of rows\ningested into a table.\n\nAdd this example code to your setup script in the same stored procedure that defines the helper function:\n\n```\n... \n // Run the merge query \n var merge_query = \"MERGE INTO target_table USING source_table ON target_table.i = source_table.i \n        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET target_table.j = source_table.j \n        WHEN NOT MATCHED \n        THEN INSERT (i, j) \n        VALUES (source_table.i, source_table.j)\" ; \n res = snowflake . execute ({ sqlText : merge_query }); \n res . next (); \n // rows ingested = rows inserted + rows updated \n var numRowsIngested = res . getColumnValue ( 1 ) + res . getColumnValue ( 2 ); \n\n // \n // Send a billable event for rows changed by the merge query \n // \n var event_ts = Date . now (); \n var billing_quantity = 2.5 ; \n var base_charge = numRowsIngested * billing_quantity ; \n var objects = \"[ \\\"db_1.public.target_table\\\" ]\" ; \n createBillingEvent ( \"ROWS_CHANGED\" , \"\" , event_ts , event_ts , base_charge , objects , \"\" ); \n // Run the rest of the procedure ... \n $$;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThis example code creates a stored procedure that calls the `createBillingEvent` function to emit a billable event\nwith the class name `ROWS_CHANGED` and a calculated base charge of `2.5` multiplied by the number of rows\ningested in the `db_1.target_table` table.\n\nNote\n\nThe types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters\nexpected by the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function.\n\n### Example: Billing based on monthly active rows ¶\n\nMonthly active rows are the number of rows inserted or updated for the first time within a calendar month. Some\nproviders use this metric to only charge consumers for unique rows updated in a month. You can modify this example to instead\ncount unique users, or identify a unique data load location to determine a base charge.\n\nThe following example shows how to create a stored procedure to emit a billable event based on the number of\nmonthly active rows. Add this example code to your setup script in the same stored procedure that defines the helper function:\n\n```\n... \n // \n // Get monthly active rows \n // \n var monthly_active_rows_query = \" \n     SELECT \n         count(*) \n     FROM \n         source_table \n     WHERE \n         source_table.i not in \n         ( \n           SELECT \n             i \n           FROM \n             target_table \n           WHERE \n             updated_on >= DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) \n         )\" ; \n res = snowflake . execute ({ sqlText : monthly_active_rows_query }); \n res . next (); \n var monthlyActiveRows = parseInt ( res . getColumnValue ( 1 )); \n // \n // Run the merge query and update the updated_on values for the rows \n // \n var merge_query = \" \n        MERGE INTO \n            target_table \n        USING \n            source_table \n        ON \n            target_table.i = source_table.i \n        WHEN MATCHED THEN \n         UPDATE SET target_table.j = source_table.j \n                    ,target_table.updated_on = current_timestamp \n        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN \n            INSERT (i, j, updated_on) VALUES (source_table.i, source_table.j, current_timestamp)\" ; \n res = snowflake . execute ({ sqlText : merge_query }); \n res . next (); \n // \n // Emit a billable event for monthly active rows changed by the merge query \n // \n var event_ts = Date . now (); \n var billing_quantity = 0.02 \n var base_charge = monthlyActiveRows * billing_quantity ; \n var objects = \"[ \\\"db_1.public.target_table\\\" ]\" ; \n createBillingEvent ( \"MONTHLY_ACTIVE_ROWS\" , \"\" , event_ts , event_ts , base_charge , objects , \"\" ); \n // Run the rest of the procedure ... \n $$;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThis example code creates a stored procedure that determines the number of monthly active rows using a merge query to identify unique\nrows. The example then calculates the base charge using the value of the `monthlyActiveRows` variable and the `billing_quantity` .\nThe base charge is then passed to the `createBillingEvent` function.\n\nNote\n\nThe types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters\nexpected by the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function.\n\nIn your setup script, add this stored procedure after the stored procedure that calls the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function .\n\n### Snowpark Python example: Billing based on rows consumed ¶\n\nTo write your stored procedure in Snowpark Python to bill based on rows consumed by your Snowflake Native App, use the following example:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE app_schema . billing_event_rows () \n   RETURNS STRING \n   LANGUAGE PYTHON \n   RUNTIME_VERSION = '3.11' \n   PACKAGES = ( 'snowflake-snowpark-python' ) \n   HANDLER = 'run' \n   EXECUTE AS OWNER \n   AS $$ \n import time \n\n # Helper method that calls the system function for billing \n def createBillingEvent ( session , class_name , subclass_name , start_timestamp , timestamp , base_charge , objects , additional_info ): \n   session . sql ( f \"SELECT SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENT(' { class_name } ', ' { subclass_name } ', { start_timestamp } , { timestamp } , { base_charge } , ' { objects } ', ' { additional_info } ')\" ) . collect () \n   return \"Success\" \n\n # Handler function for the stored procedure \n def run ( session ): \n   # insert code to identify monthly active rows and calculate a charge \n   try : \n\n      # Run a query to select rows from a table \n      query =  \"select i from db_1.public.t1\" \n      res = session . sql ( query ) . collect () \n\n      # Define the price to charge per row \n      billing_quantity = 2.5 \n\n      # Calculate the base charge based on number of rows in the result \n      charge = len ( res ) * billing_quantity \n\n      # Current time in Unix timestamp (epoch) time in milliseconds \n      current_time_epoch = int ( time . time () * 1000 ) \n\n      return createBillingEvent ( session , 'ROWS_CONSUMED' , '' , current_time_epoch , current_time_epoch , charge , '[\"billing_event_rows\"]' , '' ) \n   except Exception as ex : \n      return \"Error \" + ex \n $$;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThis example code creates a stored procedure that defines a helper method that calls the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function,\nas well as a method that calls that helper method, `createBillingEvent` , to emit a billable event\nwith the class name `ROWS_CONSUMED` and a base charge calculated by multiplying a price of `2.5` US dollars by the number of rows in\nthe `db_1.public.t1` table in the consumer account.\n\nNote\n\nThe types of the arguments passed to the `createBillingEvent` function must correspond to the typed parameters\nexpected by the SYSTEM$CREATE\\_BILLING\\_EVENT system function.\n\n## Test custom event billing ¶\n\nTo make sure that you set up Custom Event Billing properly and that billable events are emitted for usage events as you expect,\ndo the following:\n\n1. Update your application package:\n   \n    1. Update your setup script to include the stored procedures that emit billable events.\n    2. Update your application package with the new setup script.\n    3. Update the version and release directive for your application package.\n2. Share the application package with a consumer account in your organization that you have access to:\n   \n    1. Create a private listing .\n    2. Add Custom Event Billing as the pricing plan for the listing.\n    3. Share it with the consumer account.\n    5. Install the Snowflake Native App.\n3. Confirm that the stored procedures successfully emit billable events .\n4. Confirm that the listing is set up properly .\n\nNote\n\nWhen you test Custom Event Billing, you must set up a payment method but you will not be charged for usage within your organization.\n\n### Validate whether the stored procedures emit billable events ¶\n\nWhile signed in to the consumer account with which you shared your listing, call the stored procedures that you added to your Snowflake Native App.\n\nFor example, to test the stored procedure created for billing based on monthly active rows , do the following:\n\n2. Open a worksheet and set the context to `db_1.public` .\n3. Run the following SQL statement:\n   \n   ```\n   CALL merge_procedure ()\n   ```\n   \n   Copy\n   \n   If the stored procedure returns `Success` , your code is working.\n\nNote\n\nIf you run these SQL commands in the provider account that you used to create the application package, you see an error.\n\n### Validate the custom event billing pricing plan ¶\n\nTo validate the consumer experience of a Snowflake Native App and confirm that the listing and application package are set up properly, you can query\nthe MARKETPLACE\\_PAID\\_USAGE\\_DAILY View in the DATA\\_SHARING\\_USAGE schema of the shared SNOWFLAKE database.\n\nNote\n\nDue to latency in the view, run these queries at least two days after first using the Snowflake Native App.\n\nTo confirm that billable events are successfully generated by a Snowflake Native App and listing,\nrun the following SQL statement in the consumer account that you shared the listing with:\n\nNote\n\nReplace the PROVIDER\\_ACCOUNT\\_NAME and PROVIDER\\_ORGANIZATION\\_NAME values with those of the provider account.\n\n```\nSELECT listing_global_name , \n   listing_display_name , \n   charge_type , \n   charge \n FROM SNOWFLAKE . DATA_SHARING_USAGE . MARKETPLACE_PAID_USAGE_DAILY \n WHERE charge_type = 'MONETIZABLE_BILLING_EVENTS' \n      AND PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME = < account_name > \n      AND PROVIDER_ORGANIZATION_NAME = < organization_name >;\n```\n\nCopy\n\n```\n+---------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------+ \n | LISTING_GLOBAL_NAME |  LISTING_DISPLAY_NAME  |        CHARGE_TYPE         | CHARGE | \n +---------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------+ \n | AAAA0BBB1CC         | Snowy Mountain Listing | MONETIZABLE_BILLING_EVENTS |   18.6 | \n +---------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+--------+\n```\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Principles\n\n#### Business impact: Align cost with business value\n\nConnect cloud spending directly to business outcomes, ensuring that every dollar spent in the cloud contributes meaningfully to strategic objectives and demonstrable value. Embed cost considerations directly into platform planning and architecture considerations.\n\n#### Visibility: Understand & contextualize your consumption footprint\n\nYou can neither control nor optimize what you can't see. Gain deep and granular insight into all aspects of your cloud spending, fostering transparency, and attributing costs effectively.\n\n#### Control: Establish guardrails and governance\n\nEstablish policies and mechanisms to govern resource provisioning and consumption, preventing unnecessary costs and enforcing financial boundaries.\n\n#### Optimize: Maximize efficiency and value\n\nContinuously improve the efficiency of your resources and workloads to maximize the value derived from your platform investment.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThe following key recommendations are covered within each principle of\nCost Optimization:\n\n* **Business Impact**\n  \n    + **Consider cost as a design constraint:** Integrate cost\n        considerations into the architecture and design process from the\n        very beginning, making it a key non-functional requirement alongside\n        performance, security, and reliability.\n    + **Quantify value:** Develop metrics to quantify the business value\n        delivered by cloud resources (e.g., revenue per Snowflake Credit,\n        cost per customer, efficiency gains).\n    + **Trade-off analysis:** Understand the inherent trade-offs between\n        cost, performance, reliability, and security, and make informed\n        decisions that align with business priorities.\n    + **Measure business value KPIs baseline:** Once metrics to quantify\n        business value are identified and trade-offs between cost,\n        performance, and reliability are established, you need to document a\n        “baseline measurement” in order to track progress again.\n        Furthermore, you should establish a regular cadence for refreshing\n        this measurement to ensure value realization is in line with\n        expectations and business goals.\n* **Visibility**\n  \n    + **Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models:** Review\n        Snowflake’s billing models to align technical and non-technical\n        resources on financial drivers and consumption terminology.\n    + **Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy:** Implement robust and organizationally consistent tagging and\n        labeling strategies across all resources (storage objects,\n        warehouses, accounts, queries) to accurately allocate costs to\n        specific teams, products, or initiatives.\n    + **Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA:** Implement a feedback system to transparently show or charge back\n        cloud costs to relevant business units or teams, increasing\n        accountability.\n    + **Deliver clear, historical consumption insights:** Utilize\n        consistent in-tool visualizations or custom dashboards to monitor\n        consumption and contextualize spend on the platform with unit\n        economics.\n    + **Investigate anomalous consumption activity:** Review anomaly\n        detection to identify unforeseen cost anomalies and investigate\n        cause and effect trends.\n* **Control**\n  \n    + **Proactively monitor all platform usage:** Define and enforce\n        budgets for projects and services, setting soft quotas to limit\n        resource consumption and prevent runaway spending.\n    + **Forecast consumption based on business needs:** Establish a\n        forecast process to project future spend needs based on business and\n        technical needs.\n    + **Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources:** Set up\n        automated checks (e.g., Tasks, query insights) and resource\n        guardrails (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies, resource\n        monitors) to identify unusual usage patterns and potential\n        overspending as they occur.\n    + **Govern resource creation and administration:** Establish clear\n        guidelines and automated processes for provisioning and maintaining\n        resources, ensuring that only necessary and appropriately sized\n        resources are deployed (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies,\n        resource monitors).\n* **Optimize**\n  \n    + **Compute workload-aligned provisioning:** Continuously monitor\n        resource health metrics to resize and reconfigure to match actual\n        workload requirements.\n    + **Leverage managed services:** Prioritize fully managed Snowflake\n        services (e.g., Snowpipe, Auto-clustering, [Query Acceleration Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) )\n        to offload operational overhead and often achieve better cost\n        efficiency.\n    + **Data storage types & lifecycle management:** Utilize appropriate\n        storage types and implement appropriate storage configuration to\n        right-size workloads to your storage footprint. Move data to cheaper\n        tiers or delete it when no longer needed.\n    + **Workload & architectural optimization:** Leverage architectural\n        decisions for cost-optimized resource utilization while meeting\n        business needs.\n    + **Limit data transfer:** Move, secure, and back up the appropriate\n        footprint across cloud regions.\n    + **Improve continually:** As new capabilities or usage patterns\n        emerge, establish a consistent testing framework to identify areas\n        for cost efficiency.\n\n## Business Impact\n\n#### Overview\n\nTo maximize organizational outcomes, Snowflake consumption must be\nexplicitly tied to business value. While cost optimization ensures\nefficiency, it does not guarantee that spend is aligned with outcomes\nthat matter to stakeholders. Alignment of business value to cost ensures\nworkloads, pipelines, dashboards, and advanced analytics are\ncontinuously evaluated not only for cost but also for the value they\ndeliver. This approach ensures Snowflake delivers as a strategic\nbusiness platform rather than a technical expense.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nBusiness value to cost alignment represents a maturity step in FinOps on\nSnowflake. By embedding benchmarking, impact analysis, SLA definition,\nusage metrics, ROI measures, and business impact evaluation into daily\noperations, organizations can ensure that Snowflake consumption is\ncontinuously justified, optimized, and communicated in business terms.\nThis elevates the conversation with leadership from cost oversight to\nvalue realization and ensures that Snowflake is understood as a platform\nfor growth, innovation, and competitive advantage.\n\n#### Consider cost as a design constraint\n\nCost-Aware Architecting is the practice of embedding financial\naccountability directly into the design and development of Snowflake\nworkloads. By shifting left—introducing cost considerations early in the\narchitecture lifecycle—organizations ensure that ingestion,\ntransformation, analytics, and distribution workloads are not only\nperformant but also aligned with budget expectations. Many cost overruns\nin Snowflake originate from architectural decisions made without cost\nimplications in mind.\n\nFor example, designing ingestion with sub-second latency when daily\nfreshness is sufficient, or selecting inefficient table designs that\nincrease query scanning. These can lead to disproportionate spend.\nShifting cost awareness into architecture helps prevent inefficiencies\nbefore they occur and reinforces Snowflake’s role as a cost-effective\nenabler of business value.\n\nAt the ingestion layer, best practices include balancing latency versus\ncost by selecting appropriate services (e.g., Snowpipe, Snowpipe\nStreaming, or third-party tools) and choosing the right storage format\n(e.g., native tables, Iceberg). For transformations, design with\nfrequency versus SLA in mind to ensure data freshness matches the\nbusiness need. For analytics, apply schema design best practices such as\nthoughtful clustering key choices and pruning strategies to reduce\nconsumed credits. In distribution, optimize data transfer by monitoring\negress patterns and applying cost-saving practices like the [Snowflake Data Transfer Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) .\n\n#### Quantify value\n\nTo maximize organizational outcomes, Snowflake consumption must be\nexplicitly tied to measurable business value and clearly communicated in\nterms that resonate with stakeholders. Establishing baselines using\nSnowflake’s [Account Usage views](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) creates a reference point, while tracking the current state highlights\ntrends in performance and consumption. Defining explicit goal\nstates—such as reduced cost per decision, improved time-to-market, or\nbroader data access—ties workloads directly to outcomes that matter to\nstakeholders. Outliers that diverge from these goals should be flagged\nfor review and optimization to prevent wasted resources. Best practices\ninclude applying unit economic measures related to your field (e.g. cost\nper terabyte analyzed or cost per fraud case prevented) and publishing\nROI dashboards that continuously link Snowflake consumption to business\noutcomes. By incorporating measurement into daily operations,\norganizations can move the conversation with leadership from cost\noversight to demonstrable value realization, positioning Snowflake as a\nclear enabler of enterprise growth and innovation.\n\n#### Trade-off analysis\n\nDefining SLAs or explicit business needs ensures that Snowflake\nworkloads are aligned with their intended purpose and that consumption\nlevels are justified by business outcomes. Some Snowflake workloads can\nbecome over-engineered or maintained without clear justification. Tying\neach workload to an SLA or business requirement prevents waste and\nensures that investment aligns with value. Before implementation, it is\ncrucial to document and align on the value of meeting an SLA,\nidentifying all stakeholders who rely on the workload. This includes\ndifferentiating between tangible outcomes, such as increased revenue,\nand intangible outcomes, such as compliance or data trust. Efficient\ncustomers use both [Snowflake Resource Monitors](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) and Budgets features to enforce guardrails that ensure workloads remain\nwithin acceptable cost-performance boundaries. All design decisions have\ntrade-offs, and explicitly calling out the expected outcomes leads to\nstreamlined decision-making in the future when outcomes are reviewed.\n\n#### Measure business value KPIs baseline\n\nBenchmarking establishes performance and cost baselines for Snowflake\nworkloads and compares them against internal standards as well as\nperformance and cost results from previous tech solutions. These\nbenchmarks can measure workload efficiency, the adoption of specific\nSnowflake features, and the alignment of workload costs to business\noutcomes. Without benchmarks, organizations lack the context to\ndetermine if their Snowflake consumption is delivering economies of\nscale or value back to the business. Benchmarking allows teams to\nidentify best practices, track improvements over time, and highlight\noutliers that may be driving unnecessary spend or delivering unexpected\nvalue.\n\nBest practices include measuring technical unit economic metrics (e.g.\ncredits per 1K queries, credits per 1 TB scanned), warehouse efficiency\nand utilization by workload type, and business unit economics (e.g.\ncredits per customer acquired, credits per partner onboarded, or credits\nper data product-specific KPIs). This provides a more comprehensive\npicture of consumption in relation to cost and value. Outliers should be\nhighlighted in executive communications as either success stories or\ncautionary examples. Benchmarking should be embedded in a continuous\nimprovement loop, where insights drive action, action improves\nefficiency, and those improvements are effectively measured.\n\n## Visibility\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Snowflake Visibility principle is designed to transform opaque cloud\nspending into actionable insights, fostering financial accountability\nand maximizing business value within your Snowflake environment. It is\nfoundational to the FinOps framework, as you cannot control, optimize,\nor attribute business value to what you cannot see. To effectively\nmanage and optimize cloud costs in Snowflake, it's crucial to align\norganizationally to an accountability structure of spend, gain deep and\ngranular insight into all aspects of your cloud spending, and\ntransparently display it to the appropriate stakeholders to take action.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nImplementing a robust FinOps visibility framework in Snowflake,\nsupported by cross-functional collaboration, enables each business\nfunction to access timely and relevant usage and cost data. This\nempowers them to understand the business impact of their consumption and\ntake prompt action when anomalies arise. To meet this vision, consider\nthe following recommendations based on industry best practices and\nSnowflake's capabilities:\n\n#### Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models\n\nIt is essential to review Snowflake's billing models to align technical\nand non-technical resources on financial drivers and consumption\nterminology. Snowflake's elastic, credit-based consumption model charges\nseparately for compute (Virtual Warehouses, Compute Pools, etc),\nstorage, data transfer, and various serverless features (e.g., Snowpipe,\nAutomatic Clustering, Search Optimization, Replication/Failover, AI\nServices). Understanding the interplay of these billing types ensures\nyou can attribute costs associated with each category’s unique usage\nparameters. High-level categories are below.\n\n* **Compute (Virtual Warehouses, Snowpark Container Services, Openflow):** This is often the most dynamic and largest portion of\n  Snowflake spend. Virtual Warehouses are billed per-second after an\n  initial 60-second minimum when active, with credit consumption\n  directly proportional to warehouse size (e.g., an “X-Small” Gen1\n  warehouse consumes one credit per hour, a 'Small' consumes two credits\n  per hour, doubling with each size increase) while SPCS (via [compute pools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) )\n  are billed for all uptime with a minimum of five minutes. [Openflow](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/cost) is billed per second of runtime with a 60-second minimum.\n* **Storage:** Costs are based on the average monthly compressed data\n  volume stored, including active data, Time Travel (data retention),\n  and Fail-safe (disaster recovery) data. The price per terabyte (TB)\n  varies by cloud provider and region.\n* **Serverless features:** Snowflake Serverless features use resources\n  managed by Snowflake, not the user, which automatically scale to meet\n  the needs of a workload. This allows Snowflake to pass on efficiencies\n  and reduce platform administration while providing increased\n  performance to customers. The cost varies by feature and is outlined\n  in Snowflake’s Credit Consumption Document .\n* **Cloud services layer:** This encompasses essential background\n  services, including query compilation, metadata management,\n  information schema access, access controls, and authentication. Usage\n  for cloud services is only charged if the daily consumption of cloud\n  services exceeds 10% of the daily usage of virtual warehouses.\n* **AI features:** Snowflake additionally offers artificial intelligence\n  features that run on Snowflake-managed compute resources, including\n  Cortex AISQL functions (e.g. COMPLETE, CLASSIFY, etc.), Cortex\n  Analyst, Cortex Search, Fine Tuning, and Document AI. The usage of\n  these features, often with tokens, are converted to credits to unify\n  with the rest of Snowflake’s billing model. Details are listed in the\n  Credit Consumption Document.\n* **Data transfer:** Data transfer is the process of moving data into\n  (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake. This generally happens via\n  egress on cross-region [data replication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-cost) , [copying into/out of stage, function calls](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/cost-understanding-data-transfer) ,\n  and cross/same region [SPCS data transfer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) .\n  Depending on the cloud provider and the region used during data\n  transfer, charges vary.\n* **Data sharing & rebates:** Snowflake offers an opt-out Data\n  Collaboration rebate program that allows customers to offset credits\n  by data consumed with shared outside organizations. This rebate is\n  proportional to the consumption of your shared data by consumer\n  Snowflake accounts. See the latest terms and more details here .\n\n#### Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\n\nImplementing robust and organizationally consistent tagging and labeling\nstrategies across all resources (e.g. storage objects, warehouses,\naccounts, queries) is crucial to accurately allocate costs to specific\nteams, products, or initiatives and linking actions to outcomes.\n\n**Tagging in Snowflake**\n\nTagging can be done at several levels:\n\n* **Snowflake object tagging:** Snowflake allows you to apply [object-level tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/introduction) (key-value pairs) to accounts, warehouses, databases, schemas, users,\n  tables, and more. These tags are fundamental for apportioning costs\n  across departments, environments (dev, test, prod), projects, or lines\n  of business. Tags can also support [inheritance](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/inheritance) and [propagation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/propagation) ,\n  simplifying tagging across dependent objects. For example, instead of\n  tagging each individual table underneath a schema, tagging the schema\n  will cause all tables to inherit the tag of the schema. This\n  significantly reduces the manual effort required for tagging and\n  ensures that new objects created within a tagged schema or propagated\n  workflow automatically inherit the correct cost attribution. Snowflake\n  strongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\n  to enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG\\_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT\\_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\n  WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY and TABLE\\_STORAGE\\_METRICS to allocate usage\n  to relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\n  Snowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\n* **Query tags for granular workload attribution:** [Query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) can be set via session parameters (e.g., ALTER SESSION SET QUERY\\_TAG =\n  'your\\_tag';) or directly within SQL clients or ETL tools. This\n  associates individual queries with specific departments, projects, or\n  applications, even when using shared warehouses. This is extremely\n  valuable for shared warehouses where multiple teams or applications\n  use the same compute resource, allowing for granular showback. It is\n  also easy to programmatically make changes to query tags within\n  scripts or processes to allocate costs appropriately. Query tags can\n  be found in the QUERY\\_HISTORY view of the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT\\_USAGE\n  schema.\n\n**Tagging models**\n\nIn the initial setup of a business unit or use case, it is important to\nconsider the [model for tagging](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) costs within the platform via shared or dedicated resources. These fall\ninto three large buckets:\n\n* **Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate warehouses with a\n  department. You can use object tags to attribute the costs incurred by\n  those warehouses to that department entirely.\n* **Resources shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of\n  this is a warehouse shared by users from different departments. In\n  this case, you use object tags to associate each user with a\n  department. The costs of queries are attributed to the users. Using\n  the object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by\n  department.\n* **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\n  queries on behalf of its users. In this case, each query executed by\n  the application is [assigned a query tag](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-session) that identifies the team or cost center of the user for whom the query\n  is being made.\n\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits. Review each model before deploying resources. If an\norganization is caught between models, a common approach is to start in\na shared resource environment and graduate to dedicated resources as the\nworkload increases.\n\n**Tag enforcement**\n\nClear and consistent naming conventions for accounts, warehouses,\ndatabases, schemas, and tables facilitate immediate cost understanding.\nEnforcing robust tagging policies (e.g., requiring specific tags for new\nresource creation and using automated scripts to identify untagged\nresources) is crucial for accurate data interpretation and effective\ncost management. Without tag enforcement, it is difficult to accurately\nallocate all costs and can require manual effort, like extensive\ntag-mapping tables. Tag values are enforced within an account, but if a\nmulti-account strategy is needed for your organization, a tag [database can be replicated](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) and leveraged across all accounts to ensure consistent values are used.\nFor best-in-class visibility, it is recommended to have a tagging\nstrategy and tag all resources in an organization to allocate costs to\nrelevant owners.\n\n#### Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA\n\nTo effectively manage Snowflake spend and align business structure to\ntechnical resources, you should implement a system of showback or\nchargeback. This approach is crucial for promoting accountability and\noptimizing resource usage as there is a single owner for each object\nwithin the platform.\n\n**Showback**\n\nIf cost accountability models have not been implemented previously,\nconsider a showback model. This involves transparently reporting\nSnowflake costs to different departments or projects to raise awareness\nof their costs. By showing each team their monthly consumption (broken\ndown by warehouse usage, query costs, and storage, etc.), it encourages\na cost-conscious culture. This initial step helps teams understand the\nfinancial impact of their actions without the immediate pressure of\nbudget cuts. Tools like Snowflake's built-in [Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) & [budget](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) views, third-party cost management platforms, or custom dashboards can\nbe used to provide these reports.\n\n**Chargeback**\n\nFor more financially mature organizations, a chargeback model can be\nvery effective for managing costs. This system directly bills\ndepartments for their Snowflake usage. This creates a powerful financial\nincentive for teams to optimize their workloads. To make this transition\nsmooth and fair, you need to define clear rules for cost allocation. By\nimplementing chargeback, you turn each department into a financial\nstakeholder, encouraging them to right-size their warehouses, suspend\nthem during idle periods, and write more efficient queries. This shift\nin accountability leads to a more disciplined and cost-effective use of\nyour Snowflake environment.\n\nIn either case, having a centralized dashboard or visual for all\norganizations to review intra-period is critical for financial\naccountability and next-step actions.\n\n#### Deliver clear historical consumption insights\n\nThe most mature FinOps customers are those who programmatically and\nstrategically drive consumption insights across the business. This\ninvolves three core elements:\n\n* **Platform cost tracking:** Pinpoint specific Snowflake credit\n  consumption (compute, storage, serverless, AI, and data transfer),\n  usage patterns, and efficiency opportunities to deconstruct credit\n  usage, understand drivers, identify anomalies, and (eventually) drive\n  forecasting operations.\n* **Normalization of consumption:** Once consumption has been attributed\n  and aggregated to meaningful levels, normalizing it against relevant\n  business and technical metrics contextualizes it in relation to\n  organizational goals. It allows for the natural growth and seasonality\n  of platform usage to be put into context with business and technical\n  demand drivers.\n* **Clear reporting:** Presenting Snowflake cost data in an\n  understandable format for various stakeholders is vital. This enables\n  budgeting, forecasting, KPIs, and business value metrics directly tied\n  to Snowflake credit consumption.\n\n**Track usage data for all platform resources**\n\nTo deliver clear and actionable consumption insights, it is essential to\nleverage the rich usage data that Snowflake natively provides. The\nfoundation for all cost visibility is the **SNOWFLAKE** database, which\ncontains two key schemas for this purpose: [ACCOUNT\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) (for granular, account-level data) and [ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage) (for a consolidated view across all accounts).\n\n|Metric Category |Description |Key Metrics |Primary Data Sources |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Compute & query metrics |Understand the cost of query execution, warehouse consumption, and overall compute health. These are often the most dynamic and largest portion of your spend. |\\- Credits used: total credits by warehouse  \n\\- Query performance: execution time, bytes scanned, compilation time, parameterized query hash  \n\\- Warehouse health: % idle time, queueing, spilling, concurrency |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` (hourly warehouse credit usage)  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` (detailed query metrics and associated warehouses) |\n|Storage metrics |Costs for compressed data, including active data, Time Travel, and Fail‑safe. |\\- Storage volume (avg monthly compressed GB/TB)  \n\\- Inactive storage (Time Travel, Fail‑safe)  \n\\- Storage growth rates  \n\\- Table access (stale/unused) |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS`  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY` |\n|Serverless & AI metrics |Track credit consumption by Snowflake‑managed services and AI features. |\\- Credits used by service  \n\\- Cost per credit‑consuming events |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.<Serverless Feature>_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY`  \n\\- AI views such as `CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_USAGE_HISTORY` , `CORTEX_ANALYST_USAGE_HISTORY` , `DOCUMENT_AI_USAGE_HISTORY` |\n|Data transfer |Cost of moving data into (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake, especially cross‑region/cloud. |\\- Bytes transferred  \n\\- Transfer cost by destination  \n\\- Replication vs. egress |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATA_TRANSFER_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.DATA_TRANSFER_DAILY_HISTORY` |\n|Financial metrics |Translate credits to currency and provide org‑wide spend view. |\\- Overall dollar spend (daily)  \n\\- Spend by service type |\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.RATE_SHEET_DAILY` |\n\n**Normalize consumption with unit economic metrics**\n\nFor organizations to achieve comprehensive financial visibility, it is\nrecommended best practice to move beyond tracking aggregate spend and\nimplement Unit Economics Metrics. Unit economics provides a powerful\nmethodology for normalizing cloud consumption by tying platform costs to\nspecific business or operational drivers. This per-unit approach helps\nyou understand cost efficiency, measure the ROI of your initiatives, and\nmake data-driven decisions about resource allocation and optimization.\nBy translating abstract credit consumption into tangible metrics, you\ncan empower technical and business teams with a shared language for\ndiscussing value and cost. These metrics are commonly tracked across\ntime to show changes in efficiency or business impact.\n\n**Efficiency metrics (technical KPIs)**\n\nEfficiency Metrics are technical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that\nconnect cloud costs directly to platform operations and workloads. They\nare crucial for engineering teams and platform owners to identify\ninefficiencies, optimize resource usage, and understand the cost drivers\nof the data platform itself. These metrics provide the granular,\noperational view needed to manage the platform's performance day-to-day.\nSome common examples include:\n\n* **Cost per 1000 executable queries:** Determines the average cost for\n  a batch of one thousand queries. This metric is useful for\n  understanding the overall cost profile of analytical activity on the\n  platform and, when trended, how efficiency has changed across time.\n* **Cost per TB scanned:** Represents the average scanning cost of data.\n  This metric can help understand the cost implications of table\n  configuration (data ordering/clustering keys, Search Optimization) and\n  query efficiency.\n* **Cost per user:** Measures the average cost to support each active\n  user on the platform. This helps in understanding the cost\n  implications of user growth and identifying expensive usage patterns.\n\n> Customers can track credits (warehouse) per thousand queries within a\n> use case to see how efficiency has evolved over time and determine if\n> they are achieving economies of scale.\n> \n> \n\n**Business metrics (business KPIs)**\n\nBusiness Metrics link cloud spending to meaningful business outcomes and\nvalue drivers. These KPIs are essential for executives, finance teams,\nand product managers to understand the return on investment (ROI) of\ncloud expenditure and to allocate costs accurately across different\nparts of the organization. They answer the critical question: \"What\nbusiness value are we getting for our cloud spend?\" Examples include:\n\n* **Cost per customer:** Attributes a portion of the total platform cost\n  to each of the company's end customers. This is a powerful metric for\n  understanding profitability and cost-to-serve at a customer level.\n* **Cost per project:** Allocates cloud costs to specific internal\n  projects, products, or initiatives. This enables accurate\n  project-based accounting and helps assess the financial viability of\n  new features or services.\n* **\"Bring Your Own Metric\":** Custom define unit economic metrics that\n  are unique to your organization's business model. Examples could\n  include Cost per Transaction, Cost per Shipment, or Cost per Ad\n  Impression. Creating these tailored metrics ensures the most accurate\n  alignment between cloud spend and core business value.\n\nIf Snowflake is in the value chain for orders, the cost per order can be a good metric to tie Snowflake consumption to Business Demand Drivers.\n\n**Visualize metrics with Snowsight tools and external BI tools**\n\nA critical component of cost governance is the effective visualization\nof spending and usage data. Raw data, while comprehensive, is often\ndifficult to interpret and act upon. By translating cost and usage\nmetrics into interactive dashboards and reports, you can empower\nstakeholders—from engineers to executives—to understand spending\npatterns, troubleshoot, and make informed decisions. A multi-layered\napproach can be used to track meaningful cost metrics.\n\n* **Snowsight's built-in cost management capabilities:** Snowsight\n  provides pre-built visuals for usage and credit monitoring directly\n  within the [Snowflake Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) .\n  It allows filtering by tags (e.g., view cost by department tag),\n  credit consumption by object types, and cost insights to optimize the\n  platform.\n* **Creating custom dashboards or Streamlit apps for different stakeholder groups:** Snowsight facilitates the creation of custom\n  dashboards using ACCOUNT\\_USAGE and ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE views. Custom\n  charts in the Dashboards feature and Streamlit apps can both be easily\n  shared. Combined with cost allocation and tagging, this allows for\n  tailored views for finance managers (aggregated spend), engineering\n  managers (warehouse utilization), or data analysts (query\n  performance).\n* **Integrating with third-party BI tools for advanced analytics:** Connecting to Snowflake from tools like Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or\n  custom applications offers highly customizable and extensive control\n  over cost data visualization. Cloud-specific third-party data programs\n  (FinOps platforms) offer easier setup and more out-of-the-box\n  Snowflake cost optimization insights.\n* **Leverage Cortex Code (In Preview):** This AI Assistant capability\n  allows users to query cost and usage data in ACCOUNT\\_USAGE views using\n  natural language natively in the Snowsight UI.\n\n#### Investigate anomalous consumption activity\n\nCost Anomaly Detection is a critical component of visibility that\nleverages machine learning to continuously monitor credit consumption\nagainst historical spending patterns, automatically flagging significant\ndeviations from the established baseline. This proactive monitoring is\nessential for preventing budget overruns and identifying inefficiencies,\nshifting the organization from a reactive to a proactive cost management\nposture to mitigate financial risk. As a best practice, you should\ninitially review anomaly detection on the entire account to gain a broad\nview, then dive deeper into a more granular review for individual\nhigh-spend warehouses. [This approach](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies) allows for more targeted analysis and assigns clear ownership for\ninvestigating any flagged anomalies. There are several methods for\nanomaly detection supported by Snowflake:\n\n**Cost Anomalies in Snowsight**\n\nSnowsight, Snowflake's primary web interface, offers a dedicated Cost\nManagement UI that allows users to visually identify and analyze the\ndetails of any detected cost anomaly. The importance of this intuitive\nvisual interface lies in its ability to make complex cost data\naccessible to a wide range of stakeholders, enabling rapid root cause\nanalysis by correlating a cost spike with specific query history or user\nactivity. One of the tabs in this UI is the Cost Anomaly Detection tab,\nwhich enables you to view cost anomalies at the organization or account\nlevel and explore the top warehouses or accounts driving this change. To\nfoster a culture of cost awareness and accountability, it is a best\npractice to ensure there is an owner for an anomaly detected in the\naccount and set up a [notification (via email)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-ui) in the UI itself to ensure that cost anomalies are quickly and\naccurately investigated.\n\n**Programmatic Cost Anomaly Detection**\n\nFor deeper integration and automation, organizations can review [anomalies programmatically](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-class) using the SQL functions and views available within the SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL\nschema. This approach is important for enabling automation and\nscalability, allowing cost governance to be embedded directly into\noperational workflows, such as feeding anomaly data into third-party\nobservability tools or triggering automated incident response playbooks.\nA key best practice is to utilize this programmatic access to build\ncustom reports and dashboards that align with specific financial\nreporting needs and to create advanced, automated alerting mechanisms\nthat pipe anomaly data into established operational channels, such as\nSlack or PagerDuty.\n\n**Custom Anomaly Detection & Notification**\n\nAlthough anomalies are detected at the account and organization level,\nif you desire to detect anomalies at lower levels (e.g. warehouse or\ntable), it is recommended to leverage Snowflake’s [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) ML class and pair it with a Snowflake [alert](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) to notify owners of more granular anomalies that occur within the\necosystem. This ensures all levels of Snowflake cost can be monitored in\na proactive and effective way. As a best practice, [notifications](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/notifications/about-notifications) should be configured for a targeted distribution list that includes the\nbudget owner, the FinOps team, and the technical lead responsible for\nthe associated Snowflake resources, ensuring all stakeholders are\nimmediately aware of a potential cost overrun and can coordinate a swift\nresponse.\n\n## Control\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Control principle of the Cost Optimization framework is designed to\nmove organizations beyond cost reporting by establishing the necessary\nautomated guardrails and governance policies to manage and secure\nSnowflake consumption proactively. This framework enforces financial\ngovernance by transforming cost visibility into tangible action,\nutilizing features like budgets and resource monitors to prevent\nuncontrolled growth and ensure consumption aligns strictly with\norganizational financial policies. Control is foundational for\nmaximizing the value of the platform by ensuring disciplined and\ncost-effective resource utilization.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nImplementing a comprehensive control framework, supported by features\nsuch as Resource Monitors, Budgets, and Tagging Policies, empowers\norganizations to enforce financial accountability and maintain budget\npredictability. By adopting these controls, teams can actively manage\nspend, quickly and automatically mitigate cost inefficiencies, and\nensure the disciplined, cost-effective utilization of the entire\nSnowflake environment. The culmination of all of these controls leads to\ngreater platform ROI and minimized financial risk. To meet this goal,\nconsider the following recommendations based on industry best practices\nand Snowflake's capabilities:\n\n#### Proactively monitor all platform usage\n\nTo effectively manage and [control Snowflake spend](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling) ,\nit is essential to establish and enforce cost guardrails. Implementing a [budgeting system](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) is a key\nFinOps practice that promotes cost accountability and optimizes resource\nusage by providing teams with visibility into their consumption and the\nability to set alerts and automated actions. Budgeting helps to prevent\nunexpected cost overruns and encourages a cost-conscious culture.\n\n**Set budgets permissions**\n\nTo establish effective budgets, it's crucial to define [roles and privileges](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) by configuring the role, team, or user responsible for the resources.\nThis ensures that budget tracking aligns with specific business units or\nprojects, enabling accurate cost attribution and accountability. By\nlinking consumption to the relevant stakeholders, you can create a clear\nshowback or chargeback model, which is vital for fostering a sense of\nownership over spending. This configuration should be part of a broader,\nconsistent tagging strategy to ensure all costs are properly allocated\nto departments, environments, or projects.\n\n**Create budget categories**\n\nCategorizing costs is fundamental for granular budget management. You\ncan establish budgets based on the [account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/account-budget) or create [custom categories](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/custom-budget) using Object Tags. Custom tags, such as those for a data product or cost\ncenter, are critical for accurately apportioning costs across different\ndepartments, lines of business, or specific projects. This granular\napproach provides a detailed breakdown of where spending occurs,\nenabling more precise control and informed decision-making regarding\nresource allocation. Implementing robust tagging policies and naming\nconventions ensures consistency and facilitates the interpretation of\ncost data. Because budgets are soft limit objects, objects can be part\nof more than one budget if different perspectives need to be tracked for\ncost (e.g., cost center & workload level budgeting).\n\n**Implement a notification strategy**\n\nEffective budget management relies on timely communication. Setting up\nalerting through emails or webhooks to collaboration tools like Slack\nand Microsoft Teams provides proactive [notification](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/notifications) to key stakeholders when spending approaches or exceeds a defined\nthreshold. These alerts provide teams with an opportunity to review and\nadjust their usage before it leads to significant cost overruns. This\ncapability positions organizations for security success by mitigating\npotential threats through comprehensive monitoring and detection.\n\nNotifications are not limited to just budgets; [Snowflake alerts](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/alerts) can also be\nconfigured to systematically notify administrators of unusual or costly\npatterns, such as those listed in the Control and Optimize sections of\nthe Cost Pillar. This ensures that key drivers of Snowflake consumption\ncan be tracked and remediated proactively, even as the platform’s usage\ngrows.\n\n#### Forecast consumption based on business needs\n\nForecasting Snowflake consumption should be a strategic business\nfunction, not a mere technical prediction. The goal is to establish a\ntransparent basis for budgeting and optimizing ROI by linking\nconsumption directly to measurable business outcomes. In a dynamic,\nusage-based environment where compute costs are the most volatile\nelement of the bill, a robust framework must integrate quantitative\nanalysis of historical usage with qualitative insights into future\nbusiness drivers. The following framework outlines how to build and\nmaintain a comprehensive consumption forecast.\n\n**Establish the Baseline**\n\nThis phase focuses on understanding the source of spend and establishing\ngranular cost accountability.\n\n* **Identify demand drivers and unit economics:** To understand what\n  drives Snowflake spend, correlate historical credit, storage, and data\n  transfer usage with key business metrics like cost per customer or per\n  transaction. Use Snowflake's [ACCOUNT\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) schema, including the WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY and QUERY\\_HISTORY\n  views, as the primary data sources for this analysis.\n* **Granular cost attribution:** Accurately tie costs back to business\n  teams or workloads by implementing a mandatory tagging strategy for\n  all warehouses and queries. Align these tags with your organization's\n  financial structure to provide clear cost segmentation.\n\n**Build the predictive model**\n\nThis phase integrates historical trends with strategic business inputs\nto create forward-looking projections.\n\n* **Historical trend analysis:** Analyze past usage for trends,\n  seasonality, and outliers to inform future projections. Start with\n  simple trend-based forecasting and progressively move to more\n  sophisticated models, leveraging Snowflake’s built-in [SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/forecasting) for time-series forecasting.\n* **Driver-based forecasting:** Integrate planned business initiatives\n  and new projects directly into the model. Collaborate with business\n  leaders to gather strategic inputs such as projected customer growth,\n  new product launches, or increased data ingestion from marketing\n  campaigns.\n* **Scenario modeling:** Develop multiple forecast scenarios (e.g.,\n  \"conservative,\" \"base case,\" \"aggressive\") by applying varied growth\n  factors to key business drivers. This enables flexible planning and\n  helps mitigate financial risk.\n\n**Operationalize and optimize**\n\nThis phase links the forecast to continuous monitoring, governance, and\nproactive cost controls.\n\n* **Continuous monitoring and variance analysis:** Regularly compare\n  actual consumption against the forecast to identify and investigate\n  significant variances. This feedback loop is crucial for refining the\n  underlying model and adapting to evolving business needs.\n* **Collaborative governance:** Ensure a single source of truth for\n  consumption data by establishing a regular FinOps review session with\n  Finance, Engineering, and Business teams. Use customized dashboards to\n  present data in business-friendly terms.\n* **Implement predictive budget controls:** Shift from reactive spending\n  to a proactive model. Utilize Snowflake Resource Monitors and Budgets,\n  which employ monthly-level time-series forecasting, to define credit\n  quotas and trigger automated alerts or suspensions to prevent cost\n  overruns.\n\n#### Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources\n\nTo effectively manage Snowflake expenditure and prevent unforeseen\ncosts, it is crucial to implement a robust framework of resource\ncontrols. These controls act as automated guardrails, ensuring that\nresource consumption for compute, storage, and other services aligns\nwith your financial governance policies. By proactively setting policies\nand remediating inefficiencies, you can maintain budget predictability\nand maximize the value of your investment in the platform.\n\n**Compute controls**\n\nControlling compute consumption is often the most critical aspect of\nSnowflake cost management, as it typically represents the largest\nportion of spend. Snowflake offers several features to manage warehouse\nusage and prevent excessive costs.\n\n* **Implement resource monitors** : [Resource monitors](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) are a powerful feature for tracking and controlling credit consumption\n  across virtual warehouses or for the entire account. Their primary\n  importance lies in their ability to enforce strict budget limits,\n  preventing cost overruns by automatically [triggering actions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) ,\n  such as sending notifications and/or suspending warehouses when credit\n  usage reaches a defined quota. For effective governance, it is a best\n  practice to create multiple resource monitors at different\n  granularities (e.g., per-department, per-project) with escalating\n  actions, such as notifying administrators at 80% usage and suspending\n  all assigned warehouses at 100% usage, to cap spending. It is also\n  considered best practice to ensure there is a consistent action tied\n  to the resource monitors based on your organization’s ways of working.\n  For example, it is worth considering that set resource monitors\n  perform actions like notify to specific admin(s) within your\n  organization.\n* **Reduce Runaway Queries:** Runaway or hung queries can lead to\n  significant cost overruns. Managing long-running queries is especially\n  important for environments with ad-hoc users or complex analytical\n  workloads, where a poorly written query can consume credits for hours.\n  \n    + **Statement timeout policies** automatically terminate any query\n        that runs longer than a specified time limit. This serves as an\n        essential guardrail to prevent individual queries from consuming\n        excessive resources and impacting both cost and performance for\n        other users. The best practice is to set the [STATEMENT\\_TIMEOUT\\_IN\\_SECONDS parameter](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling-controls) at different levels—for the account, warehouse, specific users, or\n        individual sessions—to tailor controls to different workload\n        patterns, such as allowing longer timeouts for ETL warehouses\n        compared to BI warehouses. [Queued timeout policies](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling-controls) can also help remove queries that eclipse a reasonable time\n        threshold and could have been run elsewhere by users trying to\n        receive a response.\n    + **Policy-based automation** can also cancel queries pre-emptively.\n        An example is using stored procedures that leverage the [SYSTEM$CANCEL\\_QUERY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_cancel_query) function to terminate statements that exceed predefined runtime\n        thresholds or contain ill-advised logic, such as exploding joins.\n        This approach allows you to more finely customize the types of\n        queries you want to cancel, as you have full control over defining\n        the stored procedure logic.\n* **Auto-suspend policies** : Auto-suspend policies are a foundational\n  cost control for virtual warehouses, automatically suspending a\n  warehouse after a defined period of inactivity. By default, all\n  warehouses have auto-suspend enabled, however this feature can be\n  disabled, so it’s important to [monitor warehouse auto-suspend configuration](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) and ensure proper access controls are set to restrict users from disabling the auto-suspend setting. The best practice for balancing cost versus performance is to reduce the auto-suspend policy to the minimum possible (generally above 60 seconds) without affecting query caching and performance (SLA) expectations.\n\n**Storage Controls**\n\nWhile storage costs are generally lower than compute costs, they can\ngrow significantly over time. Understanding the different components of\nstorage cost and implementing policies to manage the types of storage is\nkey to keeping these costs in check.\n\n* **Staged files:** [Staged](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-stage) files are files that have been prepped for bulk data loading/unloading\n  (stored in compressed or uncompressed format). They can be stored in\n  an [external stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-create-stage) using cloud provider’s blob storage (such as Amazon S3) or an [internal stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-create-stage) within the Snowflake platform. You are only charged for data stored in\n  internal stages.\n  \n+ To help control costs on staged files, as well as improve\n        performance of data loads, you can ensure successfully ingested\n        files are removed by using the PURGE = TRUE option of the [COPY INTO <table>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) command . Alternatively, use the [REMOVE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/remove) command to remove the files in the stage.\n* **Active Storage:** [Active Storage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/info-schema/table_storage_metrics) consists of the data in a table that can be actively queried against\n  at the current point of time (i.e., without using Time-Travel\n  commands) **.** To control active storage costs, you can create a [Storage Lifecyle Policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/storage-lifecycle-policy/storage-lifecycle-policies) to automatically archive or delete data based on an expiration policy\n  you create.\n* **Time Travel:** [Time Travel](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) data is data that is maintained for all historical changes of a table\n  through its retention time, allowing for easy recovery of changed or\n  deleted data.\n  \n    + Time Travel data retention is controlled using the [DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) parameter , which can be set at a number of different object\n        levels (i.e. Account, Database, Schema, Table), so it is important\n        to monitor this setting to ensure you do not have excessive data\n        retention where it is not needed.\n    + Snowflake has a standard [data retention period](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) of one day. This is automatically enabled for all accounts, but for some tables, particularly [large, high churn tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-storage-considerations) , this one day can still result in excessive costs. To reduce costs in these cases, you can create these tables as transient with zero Time Travel retention (i.e., DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS=0) and periodically insert a copy of the table contents into a permanent table.\n* **Fail-safe:** In addition to Time-Travel, Snowflake retains\n  historical data for seven days after the Time-Travel retention period\n  expires as [Fail-Safe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-failsafe) data. This data can be requested for worst-case scenario data\n  recovery. Fail-safe applies to all tables that are created as the\n  permanent [table type](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) (which is the default table type).\n  \n+ However, for ETL or data modeling, it is common to have tables that\n        are created on a short-term basis to support transformations. For\n        these use cases, it is recommended that you use [Temporary and Transient tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-cdp-storage-costs) ,\n        which do not utilize fail-safe storage and thus do not incur\n        additional storage costs.\n* **Retained for clones:** This is data that is stored because it is\n  referenced by a clone, despite the data being deleted or outside the\n  retention period of the base table that was cloned. To control costs\n  related to these “stale” clones, it is recommended that you monitor [RETAINED\\_FOR\\_CLONE\\_BYTES](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-to-manage-RETAINED-FOR-CLONE-BYTES) and drop clones that are no longer needed. You can leverage the [Alerts and Notifications features](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-alerts) to alert you when RETAINED\\_FOR\\_CLONE\\_BYTES exceeds a threshold, prompting you to take action.\n\n**Serverless Features**\n\nFor serverless features, which do not use warehouse compute and\ntherefore cannot leverage the Resource Monitor feature, we recommend\nsetting up a budget. [Budgets](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) allow\nyou to define a monthly spending limit on the [compute costs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute) for a Snowflake account or a custom group of Snowflake objects. When the\nspending limit is projected to be hit, a notification is sent. While\nBudgets do not explicitly allow you to suspend serverless features upon\nreaching a limit (the way that Resource Monitors do), Budgets can be\nconfigured to not only send emails, but also send [notifications](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/notifications) to a cloud message queue or other webhooks (such as Microsoft Teams,\nSlack, or PagerDuty). This then gives you the ability to trigger other\nactions for remediation.\n\n#### Govern resource creation and administration\n\nTo prevent uncontrolled spend as organizations scale, it's essential to\nhave a clear management strategy for Snowflake resources, most notably,\nvirtual warehouses. This strategy should encompass a defined\nprovisioning process, ongoing object management, and automated platform\nenforcement to foster agility while maintaining financial discipline.\n\n**Centralized vs. decentralized management**\n\nOrganizations tend to adopt one of two primary approaches to managing\nSnowflake resources:\n\n* **Centralized management:** A dedicated team, such as a platform\n  Center of Excellence (CoE), handles resource creation and\n  administration policies. This ensures consistency, adheres to best\n  practices, and facilitates robust cost control. This model is ideal\n  for large enterprises where strict governance and chargeback are\n  paramount.\n* **Decentralized management:** Individual business units or teams\n  manage their own resources. This provides greater autonomy and speed\n  but can lead to resource sprawl, inconsistent practices, and\n  significant cost inefficiencies if not properly governed.\n\n**Striking the balance: the federated model**\n\nThe most effective strategy often lies in a hybrid, or federated, model.\nThis approach combines centralized governance (policies defined by a\nCoE) with decentralized execution (teams having the freedom to create\nresources within those guardrails). This balance enables agility while\nmitigating financial risk.\n\n**Core Principles for Governance**\n\nRegardless of the chosen model, these principles are essential for\neffective governance:\n\n* **Limit resource creation:** Restrict the ability to create or modify\n  virtual warehouses and other high-cost resources to a small number of\n  trusted roles to prevent uncontrolled growth.\n* **Establish a transparent workflow:** Create a clear, simple workflow\n  for provisioning resources, especially for larger warehouses. For\n  example, any request for a warehouse of medium size or larger should\n  require a business justification and an assigned cost center.\n* **Near real-time visibility:** Triggered visibility is non-negotiable\n  for monitoring resource creation and resizing. Configure alerts that\n  notify FinOps or CoE teams whenever a new warehouse is created or an\n  existing one is modified outside of a provisioning workflow. This\n  allows for immediate review and prevents overprovisioning.\n* **Enforce tagging:** Make a mandatory tagging strategy a prerequisite\n  for all resource creation. This ensures every credit spent can be\n  accurately attributed to the correct department or project, enabling\n  robust chargeback and accountability.\n* **Automate deactivation:** To prevent object sprawl, implement\n  policies that identify and deactivate stale resources after a\n  predetermined period of disuse.\n\n## Optimize\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Optimization principle of the Cost Optimization framework focuses on continuously improving the efficiency of your Snowflake resources. This includes optimizing compute, storage, data transfer, and managed services by understanding their usage and identifying areas for improvement. The frequency of optimization efforts should be guided by the metrics established in the Visibility principle and monitored through the Control principle. All recommendations within this Optimize principle are to be reviewed on a regular cadence and balanced with business and performance needs.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nSnowflake offers numerous optimization controls within its platform.\nThese features are designed to enhance efficiency and reduce\nadministrative overhead for your various workloads. Coupled with\noperational best practices that utilize features in a healthy manner,\nyou can balance performance goals with cost governance requirements to\nmeet business objectives.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you will be able to:\n\n* Reduce administration time\n* Increase workload efficiency\n* Balance cost controls and guardrails to meet service level agreements\n  and business objectives\n* Achieve healthy growth and economies of scale within your organization\n\nTo foster healthy growth and achieve economies of scale within your\norganization, we recommend the following, drawing upon industry best\npractices and Snowflake's capabilities.\n\n#### Compute workload-aligned provisioning\n\nCompute is the most significant part of any organization’s Snowflake\nspend, typically accounting for 80% or more of spend. A good warehouse\ndesign should incorporate the principles below:\n\n* Separate warehouses by workload (e.g., ELT versus analytics versus\n  data science)\n* Workload size in bytes should match the t-shirt size of the warehouse\n  in the majority of the workloads–larger warehouse size doesn’t always\n  mean faster\n* Align warehouse size for optimal cost-performance settings\n* [Utilize Multi-Cluster Warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) configuration to solve for high concurrency\n* Utilize [Query Acceleration Services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) to help with infrequent, large data scans\n* For memory-intensive workloads, use a warehouse type of Snowpark\n  Optimized or higher memory resource constraint configurations as\n  appropriate\n* Set appropriate auto-suspend settings - longer for high cache use,\n  lower for no cache reuse\n* Set appropriate warehouse query timeout settings for the workload and\n  the use cases it supports.\n\nUsing the principles above ensures that your compute costs are well\nmanaged and balanced with optimal benefits.\n\n**Separate warehouses by workload**\n\nDifferent workloads (e.g., data engineering, analytics, AI and\napplications) have varying characteristics. [Separating these to be serviced by different virtual warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) can help ensure relevant features in Snowflake can be utilized.\n\nSome examples of this include:\n\n* Optimize dashboards and reports by [reusing the warehouse SSD cache](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) for repeated select queries. This can be achieved by configuring a\n  longer warehouse autosuspend setting.\n* Loading large volumes of data using [optimal file sizes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-prepare) and utilizing all available threads in a virtual warehouse\n* Processing large data sets for AI workloads using memory-optimized\n  warehouses\n\n**Warehouse sizing**\n\nMapping the workload to the [right warehouse size](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-warehouse-size) and configuration is an important consideration of warehouse design.\nThis should consider several factors like query completion time,\ncomplexity, data size, query volume, SLAs, queuing, and balancing\noverall cost objectives. Warehouse sizing involves a cost-benefit\nanalysis that balances performance, cost, and human expectations. Humans\noften have expectations that their queries will not be queued or take a\nlong time to complete, so it is recommended to have dedicated warehouses\nfor teams.\n\nRecommendations for choosing the right-sized warehouse include:\n\n* Follow the principles outlined above and understand that this is a\n  continuous improvement process.\n* Choose a size based on the estimated or actual workload size and\n  monitor.\n* Utilize Snowflake's extensive telemetry data, such as [QUERY\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history) and [WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/warehouse_metering_history) ,\n  to validate that the warehouse size is impacting the metrics you care\n  about in the direction you intend.\n\n**Optimal warehouse settings**\n\nWhile Snowflake strives for minimal knobs and self-managed tuning, there\nare situations where selecting the right settings for warehouses can\nhelp with optimal cost and/or performance. Some of the key [warehouse settings](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse) include\n\n* Auto suspend\n* Multi-cluster settings\n* Warehouse resource constraints\n* Warehouse type\n\nTo maintain an optimal balance between cost and performance, regularly\nmonitor your resource usage (e.g., weekly or monthly) and set up\nresource monitors to alert you to high credit consumption. When workload\ndemands change, adjust your settings as needed.\n\n**Warehouse consolidation**\n\nIf you find yourself with an excess of provisioned warehouses or a shift\nin workloads necessitating consolidation, apply the aforementioned\nprinciples. Begin with the least utilized warehouses and migrate their\nworkloads to an existing warehouse that handles similar tasks.\n\nThe [WAREHOUSE\\_LOAD\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/warehouse_load_history) view can help you assess the average number of queries running on a\nwarehouse over a specific period. A useful benchmark is to aim for a\nwarehouse running queries 80% of the time it's active. Continuously\nmonitor your key metrics to ensure they still meet SLA goals and adjust\nwarehouse settings as needed.\n\n#### Leverage Managed Services\n\nTo achieve significant operational efficiency and predictable costs,\nprioritize the use of serverless and managed services. These services\neliminate the need to manage underlying compute infrastructure, allowing\nyour organization to pay for results rather than resource provisioning\nand scaling. Evaluate the following servterless features to reduce costs\nand enhance performance in your environment.\n\n**Storage optimization**\n\nSnowflake offers several serverless features that automatically [manage and optimize your tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-storage) ,\nreducing the need for manual intervention while improving query\nperformance. The following features ensure your data is efficiently\norganized, allowing for faster and more cost-effective qeuerying without\nthe burden of user management.\n\n**Automatic Clustering** is a background process in Snowflake that\norganizes data within a table by sorting it according to predefined\ncolumns. This process is critical for optimizing query performance and\nreducing costs. Benefits include:\n\n* **Improved query pruning:** By sorting data, automatic clustering\n  enables more effective pruning in SQL WHERE clauses, meaning less data\n  needs to be scanned for a given query.\n* **Faster joins:** Clustering also results in quicker and more\n  efficient join operations.\n* **Cost-efficient queries:** These benefits ultimately result in faster\n  and more cost-effective query execution.\n\n**Considerations and Best Practices:**\n\n* **Careful tuning:** It's essential to tune automatic clustering\n  carefully. Overuse of clustering keys, use of highly selective keys,\n  or frequent data manipulation language (DML) operations can\n  significantly increase clustering costs.\n* **Infrequently queried, frequently updated tables:** Exercise caution\n  with tables that are often updated but rarely queried, as clustering\n  costs may outweigh performance improvements.\n* **Cost estimation:** Before enabling, estimate clustering costs for a\n  table using Snowflake's system function for a preliminary cost/benefit\n  analysis.\n* **Strategic cluster key selection:** Optimizing clustering key\n  selection is vital to strike a balance between cost and performance.\n\n**Search Optimization Service (SOS)** enhances the performance of point\nlookup searches by creating a persistent search access path. Its primary\nvalue lies in achieving better pruning for these specific query types,\nwhich is critical for applications requiring quick response times. They\ncan be used in combination with auto-clustering and [Snowflake Optima service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-optima) .\n\n**Considerations for SOS:**\n\n* **Excessive indexed columns:** Avoid having too many indexed columns,\n  especially on high-churn tables, as maintenance costs can become\n  substantial.\n* **Inefficient cost-benefit ratio:** Tables that are frequently updated\n  but infrequently queried for point lookups can lead to an inefficient\n  cost/benefit ratio.\n* **Cost estimation:** Before enabling, estimate SOS costs on a given\n  table using a Snowflake system function to perform a preliminary\n  cost/benefit analysis. Index selection is crucial for balancing\n  performance and cost, a topic also addressed in the Workload\n  Optimization section.\n\n**Materialized Views (MVs)** are pre-computed query results stored as a\nseparate table and automatically maintained by Snowflake.\n\n**Benefits of MVs:**\n\n* **Cost efficiency:** It is often cheaper to update a materialized view\n  than to repeatedly execute full scans of large, complex base tables.\n* **Alternative table order:** MVs can provide an alternative table\n  order for queries that do not align with your existing clustering\n  design.\n\n**Considerations for MVs:**\n\n* **Infrequently queried, frequently updated tables:** Avoid creating\n  materialized views on tables that are frequently updated but rarely\n  queried, as automated maintenance costs will negate any potential\n  query cost savings.\n* **Clustering differences:** Be aware of clustering differences between\n  the base table and the materialized view, as this can lead to high\n  maintenance costs.\n\n**[Query Acceleration Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) (QAS):** QAS is a serverless feature that provides a burst of additional\ncompute resources to accelerate specific parts of a query, rather than\nreplacing an appropriately sized warehouse. It's particularly beneficial\nfor large I/O operation queries, eliminating the need to manually scale\nwarehouses up or down. QAS also helps speed up query execution when\ntable clustering cannot be altered due to other workload dependencies. A\ncost-benefit analysis should always be performed to ensure that the\ncredit consumption from QAS is justified by the performance improvement\nand the avoided cost of a larger warehouse.\n\n**Serverless tasks:** Serverless tasks enable the execution of SQL\nstatements or stored procedures on a user-defined schedule, eliminating\nthe need for a user-managed virtual warehouse. This is a cost-effective\nsolution for infrequent workloads where a warm cache offers minimal\nvalue, or for unpredictable workloads that don't utilize a minimum\n60-second usage.\n\n#### Data storage types & lifecycle management\n\nNext to compute, storage often represents the second-highest cost\ncomponent in Snowflake. Effective storage governance is a critical\nconcern for many industries due to federal and global regulations.\nSnowflake's default settings prioritize maximum data protection, which\nmay not always align with the requirements of every workload or\nenvironment. This section focuses on how to manage and configure\nstorage-related settings appropriately, ensuring that storage costs\nremain reasonable and deliver business value.\n\n**Optimizing table volume and auditing usage**\n\n* **Review policy-driven data lifecycle management:**\n  \n    + **Time Travel & Fail-safe:** Set the [DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters) parameter on a per-table or per-schema basis to the minimum required\n        for your business needs. For transient data, use [TRANSIENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) tables to eliminate Fail-safe costs.\n    + **Retained for clone:** Be mindful of cloning operations. While\n        zero-copy cloning is cost-effective initially, any subsequent DML\n        (Data Manipulation Language) operations on the clone will create new\n        micro-partitions, increasing storage costs. It is recommended to\n        drop clones when they are no longer needed.\n* **Be aware of high-churn tables:**\n  \n+ If a table is updated consistently, inactive storage (Time Travel &\n        Fail-safe data) can grow at a much faster rate than active storage.\n        A high churn table is generally characterized as one that has 40% or\n        more of its storage inactive. Therefore, aligning both the retention\n        time and the use of an appropriate table type with business and\n        recovery requirements is paramount to keeping costs under control.\n        Review High Churn tables on a consistent basis to ensure their\n        configuration is as desired.\n* **Proactively clean up unused objects:**\n  \n    + **Large tables that are never queried:** Establish a process to\n        identify, rename, and eventually drop tables that have not been\n        queried for an extended period. You can use the [ACCESS\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/access-history) account usage view to review the last time a table was selected\n        from. Snowflake’s [Cost Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) will also check weekly for unused tables on your behalf.\n    + **Short-lived permanent tables:** For staging or intermediate data\n        that is rebuilt frequently, use [TRANSIENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) or [TEMPORARY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) tables instead of permanent tables to avoid unnecessary Time Travel\n        and Fail-safe storage fees.\n* **Perform catalog & stage management:**\n  \n+ **Data archiving:** For historical data that is rarely accessed,\n        consider moving it to cooler tiers with [storage lifecycle policies](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/storage-lifecycle-policy/storage-lifecycle-policies) or deleting it altogether.\n\n**Optimizing Managed Data Structures and Access**\n\n* You do not always need to define cluster keys for all tables (unlike\n  many other relational database management systems) if Snowflake's\n  natural data loading maintains consistent micro-partition min/max\n  values relative to your query patterns. Additionally, you can disable\n  Auto-Clustering on a table while keeping its cluster key definition\n  without incurring extra costs.\n* **Infrequently used materialized views and search optimization paths:** Materialized Views and search optimization paths can incur\n  unnecessary storage and compute costs if they are no longer actively\n  utilized. Materialized Views are most effective for stable data tables\n  with repeated complex aggregations or joins, while search optimization\n  is designed for high-speed point lookup queries. Snowflake’s [Cost Insights feature](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) can help identify instances where these objects are rarely used,\n  prompting a review to determine if their performance benefits still\n  outweigh their associated costs.\n\n#### Limit data transfer\n\nData egress, the transfer of data from one cloud provider or region to\nanother, can incur substantial costs, particularly when handling large\ndata volumes. Implementing appropriate tools and best practices is\nessential to minimize these data transfer expenses and maximize business\nvalue when data egress is necessary.\n\n**Tooling: Enable proactive cost management**\n\nLeverage Snowflake's native features to gain visibility and control over\ndata transfer costs before they become a significant expense.\n\n* **Egress Cost Optimizer (ECO):** For providers of data products on the\n  Snowflake Marketplace or private listings, enabling the [Egress Cost Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) (ECO) at the organizational level is a critical best practice. ECO is\n  an automated feature for listings with Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment.\n  It intelligently routes data through a Snowflake-managed cache,\n  allowing you to pay a one-time egress cost for the initial data\n  transfer. After that, expanding to new regions incurs zero additional\n  egress costs for the same dataset. This is a powerful tool for scaling\n  your data sharing without compounding data transfer fees.\n* **Monitoring and alerts:** To effectively manage data transfer costs,\n  utilize Snowflake's [DATA\\_TRANSFER\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage/data_transfer_history) telemetry view. This view provides detailed insights into data\n  movement between different regions and clouds. Establish dashboards\n  and alerts to meticulously track this usage, enabling prompt detection\n  of any unexpected cost increases.\n\n**Architectural best practices: Design for minimal data movement**\n\nMinimizing data transfer costs for your workloads heavily depends on the\narchitecture of your data pipelines and applications. Adhere to the\nfollowing best practices to achieve this:\n\n* **Unloading Data:**\n  \n    + **Compress data:** When using the [COPY INTO <location>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) command to unload data, always use a compression format (e.g., GZIP,\n        BZIP2, or Brotli). This dramatically reduces the volume of data\n        transferred and directly lowers egress costs.\n    + **Filter before unloading:** Before unloading a large dataset, use\n        SQL to filter and transform the data. Unload only the required\n        columns and rows to minimize the volume of data that must leave the\n        Snowflake environment.\n* **Data replication:** Replicating a database to a Snowflake account in\n  a different geographical region or on a different cloud provider\n  incurs data transfer fees. While useful for disaster recovery, this\n  can become expensive if not managed carefully.\n  \n    + **Targeted replication:** If a full database replica is not\n        required, use [replication groups](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-intro) to replicate only the necessary databases or schemas. This granular\n        approach ensures you only pay for the data you absolutely need to\n        move.\n    + **Consider refresh cadence:** your frequency of refresh will affect\n        the amount of data that is replicated, since it acts like a snapshot\n        rather than every incremental change. Incremental ETL practices are\n        recommended even more with data that is being replicated vs full\n        table reloads.\n* **External network access and functions:**\n  \n    + **Minimize data egress:** [External functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions) and [external network access](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/external-network-access/external-network-access-overview) ,\n        which call remote services (e.g., APIs), transfer data out of\n        Snowflake. For best practice, filter data _before_ sending it to the\n        external service. Avoid writing functions that pass an entire large\n        table as an input; instead, pass only a small, pre-filtered subset.\n    + **Co-locate services:** If possible, deploy the remote service (like\n        an AWS Lambda or Azure Function) in the same cloud and region as\n        your Snowflake account to eliminate cross-region and cross-cloud\n        egress fees.\n* **Cross-cloud auto-fulfillment:**\n  \n+ **Embrace the cache:** As a data provider, enable [Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment) for your listings. As mentioned under Tooling, this feature\n        automates the replication process and works in conjunction with the\n        Egress Cost Optimizer to ensure you pay a single, upfront cost for\n        data transfer, even as your data product expands to new regions.\n* **Cross-region/cross-cloud Iceberg storage:**\n  \n+ **Centralize your catalog:** While Snowflake supports [Iceberg tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-iceberg-storage) that are external to its managed storage, be mindful of where the\n        data resides. If your Snowflake account and your Iceberg data are in\n        different regions, querying the Iceberg table will result in egress\n        costs from your cloud provider. For a well-architected solution,\n        keep your Iceberg data and your Snowflake account in the same region\n        to avoid these egress charges.\n\n#### Workload optimization\n\nWorkload optimization focuses on identifying the efficiency of your data\nprocessing activities within Snowflake. This involves a holistic\napproach encompassing the review of query syntax, data pipelines, table\nstructures, and warehouse configurations to minimize resource\nconsumption and improve performance. By addressing inefficiencies across\nthese areas, organizations can significantly reduce costs and accelerate\ndata delivery.\n\n**Query syntax optimization**\n\nInefficient queries often lead to excessive and hidden credit\nconsumption. Organizations can identify performance bottlenecks and\nunderstand the cost impact of specific SQL patterns by using Snowflake\nfeatures and adhering to SQL code best practices. This enables\ndevelopment teams to create more efficient and cost-effective code by\nhighlighting poor performing queries. Refer to the Performance\nOptimization Pillar of the Snowflake Well-Architected Framework for\ndetails on how to do this.\n\n**Utilize query history & insights for highlevel monitoring**\n\nFor broader visibility across all workloads, the Snowsight UI and the\nACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema are indispensable.\n\n* When looking for opportunities to improve, it is best to look for\n  queries that have excessive execution time across similarly run\n  queries. The newly created [Grouped Query History](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) aggregates queries to their [parameterized query hash](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-hash) and allows users to sort based on key performance indicators like\n  total queries, total latency, bytes scanned, and drill down into the\n  query execution across time. It is recommended to start with queries\n  with outsized latency and query runs.\n* The [Query History](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) page in Snowsight provides a high-level, filterable view of past and\n  currently running queries. It allows for you to drill into the Query\n  Profile for individual query statistics and investigation, even while\n  the query is running.\n* Snowflake's [Query Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-insights) feature (both a set of account usage tables and query profile\n  attributes) are also in Snowsight and can easily surface queries that\n  would benefit from optimization, such as queries with exploding joins\n  or ineffective filtering criteria that Snowflake will surface on your\n  behalf.\n\n**Leverage the query profile for deep-dive analysis**\n\nAfter identifying problematic queries, the [Query Profile](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) is an essential tool for understanding the execution plan of a query. It\nprovides a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of every operator involved,\nfrom data scanning to final result delivery. To gain visibility into\ninefficiencies, analysts and developers should regularly use the Query\nProfile to identify common anti-patterns like:\n\n* **Nodes with high execution time:** Pinpoint specific operations\n  (e.g., a complex join or a sort operation) that consume the majority\n  of the query's execution time.\n* **\"Exploding\" joins:** Identify Cartesian products or other\n  inefficient joins that create a much larger number of rows than\n  expected.\n* **Excessive table scanning:** In the profile, compare Partitions\n  scanned to Partitions total. A large number of scanned partitions on a\n  clustered table often indicates an opportunity to improve table\n  pruning by adding or refining cluster keys or modifying WHERE clause\n  predicates.\n* **Data spillage:** Look for operators spilling data to local or remote\n  disk. This indicates that the warehouse memory is insufficient for the\n  operation, resulting in significant performance degradation. This\n  might suggest a need to temporarily increase warehouse size for that\n  specific workload or rewrite the query to consume less memory.\n\n**Programmatically deconstruct queries for automated analysis**\n\nFor advanced use cases and automated monitoring, you can\nprogrammatically access query performance data. The [GET\\_QUERY\\_OPERATOR\\_STATS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/get_query_operator_stats) function can be used to retrieve the granular, operator-level statistics\nfor a given query ID, showing many of the steps and attributes available\nin the query profile view. This allows you to build automated checks\nthat, for instance, flag any query where a full table scan accounts for\nmore than 90% of the execution time or where data spillage exceeds a\ncertain threshold. This approach helps scale performance visibility\nbeyond manual checks.\n\n**Pipeline optimization**\n\nSnowflake pipeline optimization is about designing and managing data\ningestion and transformation processes that are efficient,\ncost-effective, scalable, and low-maintenance, while balancing business\nvalue and SLAs (service levels for freshness and responsiveness). Key\nlevers include architecture patterns (truncate & load versus incremental\nloads), use of serverless managed services (e.g., Snowpipe, Dynamic\nTables), and auditing loading practices to maximize cost and performance\nbenefits.\n\n**Batch loading**\n\nThe COPY INTO\n( [table](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) or [location](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) )\ncommand is a foundational and flexible method for bulk data loading from\nan external stage into a Snowflake table. Its importance lies in its\nrole as a powerful, built-in tool for migrating large volumes of\nhistorical data or loading scheduled batch files. The best practice is\nto use COPY INTO for one-time or large batch data loading jobs, which\ncan then be supplemented with more continuous ingestion methods like\nSnowpipe for incremental data. Additional information regarding COPY\nINTO and general data loading best practices can be found in our\ndocumentation [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/data-load-considerations) .\nSome additional best practices are outlined below.\n\n* **File and batch sizing:** Optimal performance is achieved with files\n  sized 100–250 MB compressed. Too few large files or too many very\n  small files reduce load parallelism and reduce efficiency.\n* **Parallelism:** Size and configure your warehouse cluster to match\n  the number and typical size of files to be loaded. (e.g., an XS\n  warehouse has eight threads; to utilize it fully, you need at least\n  eight files).\n* **File organization:** Partition files in external stages by logical\n  paths (date, region, etc.) to allow selective/cost-effective loads and\n  enable easy partition-level reloading.\n* **Pattern filtering:** Use COPY's pattern and files parameter to\n  precisely select the right files for each load, particularly to avoid\n  scanning entire stages.\n* **Resource management:** Use resource monitors and low auto-suspend\n  settings on load warehouses to minimize idle compute costs. For more\n  information here see our section on Resource Monitors.\\*\\* \\*\\*\n\n**Serverless ingestion**\n\nWhile named similarly, [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro) and [Snowpipe Streaming](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowpipe-streaming/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview) are different serverless methods to ingest data. You would utilize one\nversus the other depending on your SLA requirements for data delivery,\nand based on how data is landing for consumption.\n\n* **Snowpipe (file-based micro-batch ingestion)** : Use Snowpipe for\n  continuous ingestion of files where near real-time availability is\n  acceptable and ingestion frequency is moderate. File size guidance is\n  the same as COPY INTO (100-250MB). This leverages serverless compute\n  to avoid warehouse management overhead.\n* **Snowpipe Streaming (rowset-based, real-time ingestion)** : Use\n  Snowpipe Streaming for very low-latency (sub-five-second) ingestion,\n  high throughput, and streaming sources (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis, and\n  event hubs). You will want to ensure “exactly-once guarantees” with\n  offset tokens for idempotency. Ideally, you would batch insert as much\n  as possible to reduce API call overhead, but avoid building streaming\n  applications just to load large \"batch\" files.\n\n**Data Transformation Optimization**\n\nIn general, there are two major transformation strategies followed in\nSnowflake. One is “truncate & load,” which involves full data\nreplacement and reloading, and one is incrementally loading new data\ninto an object, possibly requiring an upsert operation. Below is some\ngeneral guidance on when to use each.\n\n* **Truncate & load:** This is utilized when full data replacement is\n  acceptable and the dataset volume/size allows for fast reloads. In\n  this case, data change patterns are such that identifying incremental\n  deltas is expensive or unreliable and downstream consumers can\n  tolerate occasional brief periods of incomplete data (during load).\n  \n+ **Best practices:** Schedule loads during off-peak or agreed “quiet”\n        windows. Consider transient or temporary tables to stage incoming\n        data, maximize parallelism during the load, and then do an atomic\n        swap/rename to minimize downtime. Ensure that you carefully manage\n        object dependencies, constraints, and statistical metadata refresh\n        after reloads to ensure proper performance once data is loaded\n* **Incremental loads:** Incremental loads are best when datasets are\n  large and a full reload is too costly, slow, or would create\n  unacceptable latency. Change-data-capture (CDC), event streaming, or\n  other means are available to reliably identify deltas (inserts,\n  updates, deletes). Additionally, in these cases, downstream consumers\n  require near-continuous data availability or very low data latency and\n  freshness.\n  \n    + **Best practices:** Design pipelines to deduplicate, merge, and\n        correctly apply CDC deltas using staging tables, Streams, and merge\n        operations. Ideally, you use Stream objects on source tables to\n        track changes efficiently if utilizing Streams or Tasks, and use\n        Tasks to automate processing. Dynamic tables are also an option;\n        please see below. Additionally, for batch files: organize files by\n        partitioned paths and use file loading patterns that enable max\n        parallelism (see COPY INTO guidance below).\n    + Test workloads on [Snowflake’s Generation 2 warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-gen2) that incorporate software improvements for data manipulation.\n\nA great example of truncate & load versus incremental can be seen in\nrefresh strategies for [Dynamic Tables (DTs)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-about) .\nThey are also a cost-effective and low-maintenance way to maintain data\npipelines. Dynamic tables provide a powerful, automated way to build\ncontinuous data transformation pipelines with SQL, eliminating the need\nfor manual task orchestration that was historically architected with\nstreams & tasks in Snowflake. [Streams & tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-pipelines-intro) still have their uses, but general guidance and ease of use see more\nSnowflake users leaning towards DTs for automated data pipelines since\nthe pipeline definitions are defined in one object or in a chain of\nobjects.\n\nThe [key concepts of dynamic tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-refresh) are defined in our documentation. However, best practices and\ndetermining when to use DTs versus other methods of pipeline tooling in\nSnowflake still warrant discussion, and are compared in Snowflake’s [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-comparison) .\n\nIn addition to Snowflake’s published [best practices](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-table-performance-guide) ,\nconsider the following\n\n* **Default to AUTO refresh** : Override only as needed for predictable\n  SLAs.\n* **Keep incremental refresh-friendly queries simple:** Avoid complex\n  nested joins, CTEs, and limit the number of outer joins per DT. The\n  introduction of complexity for incremental refresh may result in\n  longer times for execution, which in turn could force Snowflake in\n  AUTO to perform a full refresh rather than incremental.\n* **Incremental refresh is optimal** when less than 5% of the rows\n  change between refresh cycles, and source tables are well clustered by\n  relevant keys.\n* **For very complex/large transformations:** Chain multiple DTs for\n  better incrementalization, rather than building one massive DT.\n* **Monitor actual lag and refresh metrics** to adjust lag or warehouse\n  sizing as cost and response time needs evolve.\n* **Prefer a dedicated warehouse for DT refresh** during pipeline\n  development and cost analysis to isolate consumption, then consider\n  sharing for production.\n* **Use transient DTs** for high-throughput, non-critical staging steps\n  to keep storage costs down.\n* **Avoid non-deterministic functions in incremental DTs** (e.g.,\n  random, volatile UDFs, queries depending on CURRENT\\_USER).\n\nMore information on dynamic tables versus streams & tasks versus\nmaterialized views can be found in the Snowflake documentation [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-comparison) .\n\n**Table pruning optimization**\n\nTable scanning operations are one of the most resource-intensive aspects\nof query execution. Minimizing the scan of data partitions in a table\n(called partition pruning) can provide significant improvements to both\nperformance and cost for data operations in Snowflake. The account usage\nviews [TABLE\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/table_query_pruning_history) and [COLUMN\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/column_query_pruning_history) provide aggregated data on query execution, showing metrics such as\npartitions scanned and rows matched, which helps identify tables with\npoor pruning efficiency. By analyzing this data, you can determine the\nmost frequently accessed columns that are leading to a high number of\nunnecessarily scanned micro-partitions. Common ways to optimize these\naccess patterns are by using Automatic Clustering and Search\nOptimization.\n\nTo determine tables that can most benefit from re-ordering how data is\nstored, you can review Snowflake’s [best practice](https://medium.com/snowflake/supercharging-snowflake-pruning-using-new-account-usage-views-52530b24bf2e) on how to analyze the TABLE\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY and\nCOLUMN\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY account usage views. Fundamentally,\nreducing the percentage of partitions in each table pruned to the\npercentage of rows returned in a query will lead to the most optimized\ncost and performance for any given workload.\n\nA table’s Ideal pruning state is scanning the same % of rows matched as\npartitions read, minimizing unused read rows.\n\n**Warehouse optimization**\n\nWarehouse concurrency, type, and sizing can impact the execution\nperformance and cost of queries within Snowflake. Review the compute\noptimization section for more information into the tuning of the\nwarehouse and its effect on cost and performance.\n\n#### Improve continually\n\nOptimization is a continuous process that ensures all workloads not only\ndrive maximum business value but also do so in an optimal manner. By\nregularly reviewing, analyzing, and refining your Snowflake environment,\nyou can identify inefficiencies, implement improvements, and adapt your\nplatform to the ever-evolving business needs. The following set of steps\nwill help you continue to improve your environment as you grow:\n\n**Step 1: Identify & investigate workloads to improve**\n\nBegin by regularly reviewing (usually on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly\ncadence) workloads that could benefit from optimization, using\nSnowflake's [Cost Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) ,\ndeviations in unit economics or health metrics (from the Visibility\nprinciple), or objects hitting control limits (e.g., queries hitting\nwarehouse timeouts from the Control principle). Once identified,\ninvestigate these findings through the Cost Management UI, Cost Anomaly\ndetection, Query History, or custom dashboards with Account Usage Views\nto pinpoint the root cause. Then, using the recommendations in the\nOptimize Pillar, make improvements to the workload or object.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate & test**\n\nBefore implementing changes, estimate the potential impact on cost and\nperformance. Estimation encompasses both the expected amount of time\nrequired to make a change (for instance, consolidating warehouses will\nnecessitate more coordination effort for teams using the resource than\naltering a configuration setting) as well as the hard cost of\nimplementation. Snowflake provides helpful cost estimation functions for\nserverless features, such as [auto clustering](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_estimate_automatic_clustering_costs) and [search optimization service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_estimate_search_optimization_costs) ,\nto help make this a more data-driven process. If an estimation tool is\nnot available, making changes in a development or test environment on a\nsubset of the workload can provide an estimate and expected impact.\n\n**Step 3: Decide & implement**\n\nBased on your estimations and test results, decide whether to move\nforward with the change, ensuring the cost-benefit aligns with\nperformance or business needs. If approved, proceed to productionize the\nchange, integrating it into your live environment.\n\n**Step 4: Monitor & analyze**\n\nFinally, monitor and analyze the implemented changes to track and\nvalidate the change’s success over a period of time. This involves using\nthe same investigation methods, like utilizing the Cost Management UI\nand Account Usage Views, and comparing cost and performance metrics\nbefore and after the change to articulate the business impact. Translate\nthe technical improvements into tangible business benefits. For example,\n\"Optimizing this query reduced monthly warehouse costs by $X and\nimproved report generation time by Y minutes, allowing business users to\nmake faster decisions.\" This helps to both demonstrate the value of your\noptimization efforts to stakeholders and business value to the company.\nFinally, course-correct as needed depending on the results of the\nmonitoring\n\nThis continual improvement framework is the culmination of all subtopics\nwithin the Cost Optimization Pillar and provides a consistent way for\nyou to grow healthily on Snowflake.\n\nUpdated Nov 24, 2025\n\nThis content is provided as is, and is not maintained on an ongoing basis.
