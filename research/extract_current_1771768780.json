That calculus has evolved for most organizations, because in today\u2019s business environment, data is money. Data is the lifeblood of the modern business because of the extreme value it represents at all stages of commerce. Data about historical sales helps drive decisions about where to invest in the future. Data about how customers use a product helps determine what features to prioritize next. Data about customer demographics and their personal preferences helps direct hypertargeted marketing campaigns, boosting revenues. Put simply, in every area of sales and marketing operations, data has become essential. Smart business leaders have figured this out. They\u2019re no longer merely collecting data about their sales and customers, they\u2019re actively using that data to create measurable business value and build a competitive advantage.\n\n## What Is Data Monetization?\n\nBroadly, data monetization is the practice of using information to generate measurable economic benefits. More specifically, it involves identifying valuable data and either selling that data to others , using that data for direct marketing or leveraging data-based products to create new revenue streams.\n\n## Why Is Data Monetization Important?\n\nWhile monetizing data used to be exclusive to the world of tech giants and global conglomerates with sophisticated data science programs, today the world of data monetization has become democratized. Any organization looking to thrive can now create a data monetization strategy, using it to open up new revenue streams, enhance the customer experience or gain a competitive advantage in its industry, whether it\u2019s telecommunications , financial services , media or something else.\n\n## How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\n\nSo you want to start turning data into value in your own organization? Organizations can take one or more strategic pathways on the road to monetizing data. The correct path depends on your organization\u2019s industry, your business goals and the type of data you have available. Here are the four primary strategies that organizations can use to monetize their data assets. #### 1\\. Selling raw or aggregated data Perhaps the most foundational type of data monetization, the simplest method to turn data into money is to sell it directly, for example on a marketplace . Data about your customers has value to other businesses who want to reach them, either in the form of customer records with detailed contact information and data around their purchasing habits \u2014 or in the aggregate, where information is anonymized and consolidated through statistical methods. Raw customer data tends to be more valuable since it can be used as a direct sales lead, but this kind of data is subject to myriad privacy laws globally and may require customers to \u201copt in\u201d to data sharing. This data can also be anonymized to disguise the actual identity of the customer ( data clean rooms can be a helpful tool for this sort of task, for example). Aggregated data, which does not include personally identifiable information about the customer, carries less of a compliance risk, but typically also holds less value. In either case, a data monetization market can be helpful as an additional revenue stream. #### 2\\. Offering \"Data as a Service\" (DaaS) Data as a Service is an emerging business model that makes data available to customers on demand. DaaS services may be built around similar data types to those outlined in the previous section, but DaaS can offer advantages in both speed and data quality. With DaaS, data is available at the ready for customers to access any time and in an API-enabled format that can integrate directly into a workflow. DaaS systems also often include automated data management tools that improve data integrity and quality over what traditional data platforms (such as CRM systems) can offer. #### 3\\. Providing analytics and insights If you can\u2019t (or don\u2019t want to) sell the data itself, you can analyze that data and sell information derived from it. This is of course the primary business model for analyst firms, which collect data and then sell the reports they generate after analyzing it. Insights into customer and market trends can be of great value to other companies operating in the same industry or a related one. #### 4\\. Offering data-enhanced products and services A final data monetization strategy is to use data to upgrade the products or services you already provide or to improve the way they are sold. This could take the form of creating a personalized product, such as a bespoke fitness program designed for an individual customer based on data about their particular health needs. Or it could include designing upsell/cross-sell activities, such as the data-driven recommendations to purchase related products that are common on online retail websites.\n\n## Key Challenges of Data Monetization\n\nData monetization does not come without its share of challenges, some of which can be daunting. The most notable challenges include: #### Data privacy and governance Arguably both the most difficult and the most common obstacle to monetizing data, the tangle of privacy laws and regulations worldwide that govern the way customer information is stored and shared can trouble even the most seasoned organizations. Failure to comply with data privacy rules can lead to stiff penalties and loss of reputation \u2014 even if the failure is accidental. Ensuring the highest levels of governance over customer data is paramount for any data monetization effort. #### Identifying valuable data assets How do you know data has value? Many organizations undertake monetization strategies only to find out after substantial work has been done that there\u2019s no market for the data or that the value of the data is less than expected. Understanding whether the end result of a data monetization effort is likely to bear financial fruit must be a key first step in any undertaking. #### Data quality and standardization Many organizations may have a treasure trove of data, only for further analysis to reveal that data is incomplete, poor in quality or stored in inconsistent, incompatible formats. Data that is improperly cleansed and standardized ahead of a monetization effort is likely to lead to a poor end result.\n\n## Use Cases and Examples of Data Monetization\n\nExamples of successful data monetization initiatives are all around us. Here are some key use cases where organizations are finding success with the business strategy. #### In retail Retail is one of the heaviest users of data monetization, because the industry habitually collects a large amount of very valuable data. Retailers leverage data monetization daily by suggesting additional items for shoppers to buy after purchasing a product. And those famously long CVS receipts with coupons at the bottom? Those aren\u2019t random \u2014 [they\u2019re tied to items the customer is likely to purchase next](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/business/cvs-receipts-long-extracare-rewards) , enticing them to return on another day. Many retailers , especially grocery stores, use loyalty programs to closely track what a customer buys, helping them plan promotions and optimize inventory. #### In financial services All those credit card offers you receive in the mail aren\u2019t generated arbitrarily. They\u2019re the result of financially driven data monetization strategies that target customers based on an analysis of their purchasing habits and credit history. Data models can help prioritize the customers with the highest potential value and the lowest risk, and financial institutions use this data to target those customers with personalized financial products. Payment processors also commonly aggregate transaction data and sell this information to merchants and manufacturers to help them create targeted marketing campaigns. #### In manufacturing Manufacturers can collect data about the way their products are used and sell it to companies in complementary industries. For example, automakers can sell information about driving habits collected by onboard computers to fuel companies and tire manufacturers. An equipment manufacturer can gather information about how its products are performing in the field and use that information to offer service plans designed to provide preventive maintenance. Regardless of your organization\u2019s industry, data monetization can be a strong benefit \u2014 especially if you have the right tooling in place to manage and govern the data you want to monetize.\n\n## Customers using Snowflake Data Clean Rooms\n\n#### Indeed Reimagines Architecture and Data Collaboration to Help Job Seekers and Employers With a modern data lake architecture and Snowflake Data Clean Rooms, Indeed centralizes all its data, delivers campaigns faster, and ultimately saves the company millions of dollars.

It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Principles\n\n#### Business impact: Align cost with business value\n\nConnect cloud spending directly to business outcomes, ensuring that every dollar spent in the cloud contributes meaningfully to strategic objectives and demonstrable value. Embed cost considerations directly into platform planning and architecture considerations.\n\n#### Visibility: Understand & contextualize your consumption footprint\n\nYou can neither control nor optimize what you can't see. Gain deep and granular insight into all aspects of your cloud spending, fostering transparency, and attributing costs effectively.\n\n#### Control: Establish guardrails and governance\n\nEstablish policies and mechanisms to govern resource provisioning and consumption, preventing unnecessary costs and enforcing financial boundaries.\n\n#### Optimize: Maximize efficiency and value\n\nContinuously improve the efficiency of your resources and workloads to maximize the value derived from your platform investment.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThe following key recommendations are covered within each principle of\nCost Optimization:\n\n* **Business Impact**\n  \n    + **Consider cost as a design constraint:** Integrate cost\n        considerations into the architecture and design process from the\n        very beginning, making it a key non-functional requirement alongside\n        performance, security, and reliability.\n    + **Quantify value:** Develop metrics to quantify the business value\n        delivered by cloud resources (e.g., revenue per Snowflake Credit,\n        cost per customer, efficiency gains).\n    + **Trade-off analysis:** Understand the inherent trade-offs between\n        cost, performance, reliability, and security, and make informed\n        decisions that align with business priorities.\n    + **Measure business value KPIs baseline:** Once metrics to quantify\n        business value are identified and trade-offs between cost,\n        performance, and reliability are established, you need to document a\n        \u201cbaseline measurement\u201d in order to track progress again.\n        Furthermore, you should establish a regular cadence for refreshing\n        this measurement to ensure value realization is in line with\n        expectations and business goals.\n* **Visibility**\n  \n    + **Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models:** Review\n        Snowflake\u2019s billing models to align technical and non-technical\n        resources on financial drivers and consumption terminology.\n    + **Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy:** Implement robust and organizationally consistent tagging and\n        labeling strategies across all resources (storage objects,\n        warehouses, accounts, queries) to accurately allocate costs to\n        specific teams, products, or initiatives.\n    + **Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA:** Implement a feedback system to transparently show or charge back\n        cloud costs to relevant business units or teams, increasing\n        accountability.\n    + **Deliver clear, historical consumption insights:** Utilize\n        consistent in-tool visualizations or custom dashboards to monitor\n        consumption and contextualize spend on the platform with unit\n        economics.\n    + **Investigate anomalous consumption activity:** Review anomaly\n        detection to identify unforeseen cost anomalies and investigate\n        cause and effect trends.\n* **Control**\n  \n    + **Proactively monitor all platform usage:** Define and enforce\n        budgets for projects and services, setting soft quotas to limit\n        resource consumption and prevent runaway spending.\n    + **Forecast consumption based on business needs:** Establish a\n        forecast process to project future spend needs based on business and\n        technical needs.\n    + **Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources:** Set up\n        automated checks (e.g., Tasks, query insights) and resource\n        guardrails (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies, resource\n        monitors) to identify unusual usage patterns and potential\n        overspending as they occur.\n    + **Govern resource creation and administration:** Establish clear\n        guidelines and automated processes for provisioning and maintaining\n        resources, ensuring that only necessary and appropriately sized\n        resources are deployed (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies,\n        resource monitors).\n* **Optimize**\n  \n    + **Compute workload-aligned provisioning:** Continuously monitor\n        resource health metrics to resize and reconfigure to match actual\n        workload requirements.\n    + **Leverage managed services:** Prioritize fully managed Snowflake\n        services (e.g., Snowpipe, Auto-clustering, [Query Acceleration Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) )\n        to offload operational overhead and often achieve better cost\n        efficiency.\n    + **Data storage types & lifecycle management:** Utilize appropriate\n        storage types and implement appropriate storage configuration to\n        right-size workloads to your storage footprint. Move data to cheaper\n        tiers or delete it when no longer needed.\n    + **Workload & architectural optimization:** Leverage architectural\n        decisions for cost-optimized resource utilization while meeting\n        business needs.\n    + **Limit data transfer:** Move, secure, and back up the appropriate\n        footprint across cloud regions.\n    + **Improve continually:** As new capabilities or usage patterns\n        emerge, establish a consistent testing framework to identify areas\n        for cost efficiency.\n\n## Business Impact\n\n#### Overview\n\nTo maximize organizational outcomes, Snowflake consumption must be\nexplicitly tied to business value. While cost optimization ensures\nefficiency, it does not guarantee that spend is aligned with outcomes\nthat matter to stakeholders. Alignment of business value to cost ensures\nworkloads, pipelines, dashboards, and advanced analytics are\ncontinuously evaluated not only for cost but also for the value they\ndeliver. This approach ensures Snowflake delivers as a strategic\nbusiness platform rather than a technical expense.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nBusiness value to cost alignment represents a maturity step in FinOps on\nSnowflake. By embedding benchmarking, impact analysis, SLA definition,\nusage metrics, ROI measures, and business impact evaluation into daily\noperations, organizations can ensure that Snowflake consumption is\ncontinuously justified, optimized, and communicated in business terms.\nThis elevates the conversation with leadership from cost oversight to\nvalue realization and ensures that Snowflake is understood as a platform\nfor growth, innovation, and competitive advantage.\n\n#### Consider cost as a design constraint\n\nCost-Aware Architecting is the practice of embedding financial\naccountability directly into the design and development of Snowflake\nworkloads. By shifting left\u2014introducing cost considerations early in the\narchitecture lifecycle\u2014organizations ensure that ingestion,\ntransformation, analytics, and distribution workloads are not only\nperformant but also aligned with budget expectations. Many cost overruns\nin Snowflake originate from architectural decisions made without cost\nimplications in mind.\n\nFor example, designing ingestion with sub-second latency when daily\nfreshness is sufficient, or selecting inefficient table designs that\nincrease query scanning. These can lead to disproportionate spend.\nShifting cost awareness into architecture helps prevent inefficiencies\nbefore they occur and reinforces Snowflake\u2019s role as a cost-effective\nenabler of business value.\n\nAt the ingestion layer, best practices include balancing latency versus\ncost by selecting appropriate services (e.g., Snowpipe, Snowpipe\nStreaming, or third-party tools) and choosing the right storage format\n(e.g., native tables, Iceberg). For transformations, design with\nfrequency versus SLA in mind to ensure data freshness matches the\nbusiness need. For analytics, apply schema design best practices such as\nthoughtful clustering key choices and pruning strategies to reduce\nconsumed credits. In distribution, optimize data transfer by monitoring\negress patterns and applying cost-saving practices like the [Snowflake Data Transfer Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) .\n\n#### Quantify value\n\nTo maximize organizational outcomes, Snowflake consumption must be\nexplicitly tied to measurable business value and clearly communicated in\nterms that resonate with stakeholders. Establishing baselines using\nSnowflake\u2019s [Account Usage views](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) creates a reference point, while tracking the current state highlights\ntrends in performance and consumption. Defining explicit goal\nstates\u2014such as reduced cost per decision, improved time-to-market, or\nbroader data access\u2014ties workloads directly to outcomes that matter to\nstakeholders. Outliers that diverge from these goals should be flagged\nfor review and optimization to prevent wasted resources. Best practices\ninclude applying unit economic measures related to your field (e.g. cost\nper terabyte analyzed or cost per fraud case prevented) and publishing\nROI dashboards that continuously link Snowflake consumption to business\noutcomes. By incorporating measurement into daily operations,\norganizations can move the conversation with leadership from cost\noversight to demonstrable value realization, positioning Snowflake as a\nclear enabler of enterprise growth and innovation.\n\n#### Trade-off analysis\n\nDefining SLAs or explicit business needs ensures that Snowflake\nworkloads are aligned with their intended purpose and that consumption\nlevels are justified by business outcomes. Some Snowflake workloads can\nbecome over-engineered or maintained without clear justification. Tying\neach workload to an SLA or business requirement prevents waste and\nensures that investment aligns with value. Before implementation, it is\ncrucial to document and align on the value of meeting an SLA,\nidentifying all stakeholders who rely on the workload. This includes\ndifferentiating between tangible outcomes, such as increased revenue,\nand intangible outcomes, such as compliance or data trust. Efficient\ncustomers use both [Snowflake Resource Monitors](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) and Budgets features to enforce guardrails that ensure workloads remain\nwithin acceptable cost-performance boundaries. All design decisions have\ntrade-offs, and explicitly calling out the expected outcomes leads to\nstreamlined decision-making in the future when outcomes are reviewed.\n\n#### Measure business value KPIs baseline\n\nBenchmarking establishes performance and cost baselines for Snowflake\nworkloads and compares them against internal standards as well as\nperformance and cost results from previous tech solutions. These\nbenchmarks can measure workload efficiency, the adoption of specific\nSnowflake features, and the alignment of workload costs to business\noutcomes. Without benchmarks, organizations lack the context to\ndetermine if their Snowflake consumption is delivering economies of\nscale or value back to the business. Benchmarking allows teams to\nidentify best practices, track improvements over time, and highlight\noutliers that may be driving unnecessary spend or delivering unexpected\nvalue.\n\nBest practices include measuring technical unit economic metrics (e.g.\ncredits per 1K queries, credits per 1 TB scanned), warehouse efficiency\nand utilization by workload type, and business unit economics (e.g.\ncredits per customer acquired, credits per partner onboarded, or credits\nper data product-specific KPIs). This provides a more comprehensive\npicture of consumption in relation to cost and value. Outliers should be\nhighlighted in executive communications as either success stories or\ncautionary examples. Benchmarking should be embedded in a continuous\nimprovement loop, where insights drive action, action improves\nefficiency, and those improvements are effectively measured.\n\n## Visibility\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Snowflake Visibility principle is designed to transform opaque cloud\nspending into actionable insights, fostering financial accountability\nand maximizing business value within your Snowflake environment. It is\nfoundational to the FinOps framework, as you cannot control, optimize,\nor attribute business value to what you cannot see. To effectively\nmanage and optimize cloud costs in Snowflake, it's crucial to align\norganizationally to an accountability structure of spend, gain deep and\ngranular insight into all aspects of your cloud spending, and\ntransparently display it to the appropriate stakeholders to take action.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nImplementing a robust FinOps visibility framework in Snowflake,\nsupported by cross-functional collaboration, enables each business\nfunction to access timely and relevant usage and cost data. This\nempowers them to understand the business impact of their consumption and\ntake prompt action when anomalies arise. To meet this vision, consider\nthe following recommendations based on industry best practices and\nSnowflake's capabilities:\n\n#### Understand Snowflake\u2019s resource billing models\n\nIt is essential to review Snowflake's billing models to align technical\nand non-technical resources on financial drivers and consumption\nterminology. Snowflake's elastic, credit-based consumption model charges\nseparately for compute (Virtual Warehouses, Compute Pools, etc),\nstorage, data transfer, and various serverless features (e.g., Snowpipe,\nAutomatic Clustering, Search Optimization, Replication/Failover, AI\nServices). Understanding the interplay of these billing types ensures\nyou can attribute costs associated with each category\u2019s unique usage\nparameters. High-level categories are below.\n\n* **Compute (Virtual Warehouses, Snowpark Container Services, Openflow):** This is often the most dynamic and largest portion of\n  Snowflake spend. Virtual Warehouses are billed per-second after an\n  initial 60-second minimum when active, with credit consumption\n  directly proportional to warehouse size (e.g., an \u201cX-Small\u201d Gen1\n  warehouse consumes one credit per hour, a 'Small' consumes two credits\n  per hour, doubling with each size increase) while SPCS (via [compute pools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) )\n  are billed for all uptime with a minimum of five minutes. [Openflow](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/cost) is billed per second of runtime with a 60-second minimum.\n* **Storage:** Costs are based on the average monthly compressed data\n  volume stored, including active data, Time Travel (data retention),\n  and Fail-safe (disaster recovery) data. The price per terabyte (TB)\n  varies by cloud provider and region.\n* **Serverless features:** Snowflake Serverless features use resources\n  managed by Snowflake, not the user, which automatically scale to meet\n  the needs of a workload. This allows Snowflake to pass on efficiencies\n  and reduce platform administration while providing increased\n  performance to customers. The cost varies by feature and is outlined\n  in Snowflake\u2019s Credit Consumption Document .\n* **Cloud services layer:** This encompasses essential background\n  services, including query compilation, metadata management,\n  information schema access, access controls, and authentication. Usage\n  for cloud services is only charged if the daily consumption of cloud\n  services exceeds 10% of the daily usage of virtual warehouses.\n* **AI features:** Snowflake additionally offers artificial intelligence\n  features that run on Snowflake-managed compute resources, including\n  Cortex AISQL functions (e.g. COMPLETE, CLASSIFY, etc.), Cortex\n  Analyst, Cortex Search, Fine Tuning, and Document AI. The usage of\n  these features, often with tokens, are converted to credits to unify\n  with the rest of Snowflake\u2019s billing model. Details are listed in the\n  Credit Consumption Document.\n* **Data transfer:** Data transfer is the process of moving data into\n  (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake. This generally happens via\n  egress on cross-region [data replication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-cost) , [copying into/out of stage, function calls](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/cost-understanding-data-transfer) ,\n  and cross/same region [SPCS data transfer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) .\n  Depending on the cloud provider and the region used during data\n  transfer, charges vary.\n* **Data sharing & rebates:** Snowflake offers an opt-out Data\n  Collaboration rebate program that allows customers to offset credits\n  by data consumed with shared outside organizations. This rebate is\n  proportional to the consumption of your shared data by consumer\n  Snowflake accounts. See the latest terms and more details here .\n\n#### Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\n\nImplementing robust and organizationally consistent tagging and labeling\nstrategies across all resources (e.g. storage objects, warehouses,\naccounts, queries) is crucial to accurately allocate costs to specific\nteams, products, or initiatives and linking actions to outcomes.\n\n**Tagging in Snowflake**\n\nTagging can be done at several levels:\n\n* **Snowflake object tagging:** Snowflake allows you to apply [object-level tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/introduction) (key-value pairs) to accounts, warehouses, databases, schemas, users,\n  tables, and more. These tags are fundamental for apportioning costs\n  across departments, environments (dev, test, prod), projects, or lines\n  of business. Tags can also support [inheritance](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/inheritance) and [propagation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/propagation) ,\n  simplifying tagging across dependent objects. For example, instead of\n  tagging each individual table underneath a schema, tagging the schema\n  will cause all tables to inherit the tag of the schema. This\n  significantly reduces the manual effort required for tagging and\n  ensures that new objects created within a tagged schema or propagated\n  workflow automatically inherit the correct cost attribution. Snowflake\n  strongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\n  to enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG\\_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT\\_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\n  WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY and TABLE\\_STORAGE\\_METRICS to allocate usage\n  to relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\n  Snowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\n* **Query tags for granular workload attribution:** [Query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) can be set via session parameters (e.g., ALTER SESSION SET QUERY\\_TAG =\n  'your\\_tag';) or directly within SQL clients or ETL tools. This\n  associates individual queries with specific departments, projects, or\n  applications, even when using shared warehouses. This is extremely\n  valuable for shared warehouses where multiple teams or applications\n  use the same compute resource, allowing for granular showback. It is\n  also easy to programmatically make changes to query tags within\n  scripts or processes to allocate costs appropriately. Query tags can\n  be found in the QUERY\\_HISTORY view of the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT\\_USAGE\n  schema.\n\n**Tagging models**\n\nIn the initial setup of a business unit or use case, it is important to\nconsider the [model for tagging](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) costs within the platform via shared or dedicated resources. These fall\ninto three large buckets:\n\n* **Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate warehouses with a\n  department. You can use object tags to attribute the costs incurred by\n  those warehouses to that department entirely.\n* **Resources shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of\n  this is a warehouse shared by users from different departments. In\n  this case, you use object tags to associate each user with a\n  department. The costs of queries are attributed to the users. Using\n  the object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by\n  department.\n* **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\n  queries on behalf of its users. In this case, each query executed by\n  the application is [assigned a query tag](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-session) that identifies the team or cost center of the user for whom the query\n  is being made.\n\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits. Review each model before deploying resources. If an\norganization is caught between models, a common approach is to start in\na shared resource environment and graduate to dedicated resources as the\nworkload increases.\n\n**Tag enforcement**\n\nClear and consistent naming conventions for accounts, warehouses,\ndatabases, schemas, and tables facilitate immediate cost understanding.\nEnforcing robust tagging policies (e.g., requiring specific tags for new\nresource creation and using automated scripts to identify untagged\nresources) is crucial for accurate data interpretation and effective\ncost management. Without tag enforcement, it is difficult to accurately\nallocate all costs and can require manual effort, like extensive\ntag-mapping tables. Tag values are enforced within an account, but if a\nmulti-account strategy is needed for your organization, a tag [database can be replicated](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) and leveraged across all accounts to ensure consistent values are used.\nFor best-in-class visibility, it is recommended to have a tagging\nstrategy and tag all resources in an organization to allocate costs to\nrelevant owners.\n\n#### Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA\n\nTo effectively manage Snowflake spend and align business structure to\ntechnical resources, you should implement a system of showback or\nchargeback. This approach is crucial for promoting accountability and\noptimizing resource usage as there is a single owner for each object\nwithin the platform.\n\n**Showback**\n\nIf cost accountability models have not been implemented previously,\nconsider a showback model. This involves transparently reporting\nSnowflake costs to different departments or projects to raise awareness\nof their costs. By showing each team their monthly consumption (broken\ndown by warehouse usage, query costs, and storage, etc.), it encourages\na cost-conscious culture. This initial step helps teams understand the\nfinancial impact of their actions without the immediate pressure of\nbudget cuts. Tools like Snowflake's built-in [Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) & [budget](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) views, third-party cost management platforms, or custom dashboards can\nbe used to provide these reports.\n\n**Chargeback**\n\nFor more financially mature organizations, a chargeback model can be\nvery effective for managing costs. This system directly bills\ndepartments for their Snowflake usage. This creates a powerful financial\nincentive for teams to optimize their workloads. To make this transition\nsmooth and fair, you need to define clear rules for cost allocation. By\nimplementing chargeback, you turn each department into a financial\nstakeholder, encouraging them to right-size their warehouses, suspend\nthem during idle periods, and write more efficient queries. This shift\nin accountability leads to a more disciplined and cost-effective use of\nyour Snowflake environment.\n\nIn either case, having a centralized dashboard or visual for all\norganizations to review intra-period is critical for financial\naccountability and next-step actions.\n\n#### Deliver clear historical consumption insights\n\nThe most mature FinOps customers are those who programmatically and\nstrategically drive consumption insights across the business. This\ninvolves three core elements:\n\n* **Platform cost tracking:** Pinpoint specific Snowflake credit\n  consumption (compute, storage, serverless, AI, and data transfer),\n  usage patterns, and efficiency opportunities to deconstruct credit\n  usage, understand drivers, identify anomalies, and (eventually) drive\n  forecasting operations.\n* **Normalization of consumption:** Once consumption has been attributed\n  and aggregated to meaningful levels, normalizing it against relevant\n  business and technical metrics contextualizes it in relation to\n  organizational goals. It allows for the natural growth and seasonality\n  of platform usage to be put into context with business and technical\n  demand drivers.\n* **Clear reporting:** Presenting Snowflake cost data in an\n  understandable format for various stakeholders is vital. This enables\n  budgeting, forecasting, KPIs, and business value metrics directly tied\n  to Snowflake credit consumption.\n\n**Track usage data for all platform resources**\n\nTo deliver clear and actionable consumption insights, it is essential to\nleverage the rich usage data that Snowflake natively provides. The\nfoundation for all cost visibility is the **SNOWFLAKE** database, which\ncontains two key schemas for this purpose: [ACCOUNT\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) (for granular, account-level data) and [ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage) (for a consolidated view across all accounts).\n\n|Metric Category |Description |Key Metrics |Primary Data Sources |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Compute & query metrics |Understand the cost of query execution, warehouse consumption, and overall compute health. These are often the most dynamic and largest portion of your spend. |\\- Credits used: total credits by warehouse  \n\\- Query performance: execution time, bytes scanned, compilation time, parameterized query hash  \n\\- Warehouse health: % idle time, queueing, spilling, concurrency |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` (hourly warehouse credit usage)  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` (detailed query metrics and associated warehouses) |\n|Storage metrics |Costs for compressed data, including active data, Time Travel, and Fail\u2011safe. |\\- Storage volume (avg monthly compressed GB/TB)  \n\\- Inactive storage (Time Travel, Fail\u2011safe)  \n\\- Storage growth rates  \n\\- Table access (stale/unused) |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS`  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY` |\n|Serverless & AI metrics |Track credit consumption by Snowflake\u2011managed services and AI features. |\\- Credits used by service  \n\\- Cost per credit\u2011consuming events |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.<Serverless Feature>_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY`  \n\\- AI views such as `CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_USAGE_HISTORY` , `CORTEX_ANALYST_USAGE_HISTORY` , `DOCUMENT_AI_USAGE_HISTORY` |\n|Data transfer |Cost of moving data into (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake, especially cross\u2011region/cloud. |\\- Bytes transferred  \n\\- Transfer cost by destination  \n\\- Replication vs. egress |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATA_TRANSFER_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.DATA_TRANSFER_DAILY_HISTORY` |\n|Financial metrics |Translate credits to currency and provide org\u2011wide spend view. |\\- Overall dollar spend (daily)  \n\\- Spend by service type |\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.RATE_SHEET_DAILY` |\n\n**Normalize consumption with unit economic metrics**\n\nFor organizations to achieve comprehensive financial visibility, it is\nrecommended best practice to move beyond tracking aggregate spend and\nimplement Unit Economics Metrics. Unit economics provides a powerful\nmethodology for normalizing cloud consumption by tying platform costs to\nspecific business or operational drivers. This per-unit approach helps\nyou understand cost efficiency, measure the ROI of your initiatives, and\nmake data-driven decisions about resource allocation and optimization.\nBy translating abstract credit consumption into tangible metrics, you\ncan empower technical and business teams with a shared language for\ndiscussing value and cost. These metrics are commonly tracked across\ntime to show changes in efficiency or business impact.\n\n**Efficiency metrics (technical KPIs)**\n\nEfficiency Metrics are technical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that\nconnect cloud costs directly to platform operations and workloads. They\nare crucial for engineering teams and platform owners to identify\ninefficiencies, optimize resource usage, and understand the cost drivers\nof the data platform itself. These metrics provide the granular,\noperational view needed to manage the platform's performance day-to-day.\nSome common examples include:\n\n* **Cost per 1000 executable queries:** Determines the average cost for\n  a batch of one thousand queries. This metric is useful for\n  understanding the overall cost profile of analytical activity on the\n  platform and, when trended, how efficiency has changed across time.\n* **Cost per TB scanned:** Represents the average scanning cost of data.\n  This metric can help understand the cost implications of table\n  configuration (data ordering/clustering keys, Search Optimization) and\n  query efficiency.\n* **Cost per user:** Measures the average cost to support each active\n  user on the platform. This helps in understanding the cost\n  implications of user growth and identifying expensive usage patterns.\n\n> Customers can track credits (warehouse) per thousand queries within a\n> use case to see how efficiency has evolved over time and determine if\n> they are achieving economies of scale.\n> \n> \n\n**Business metrics (business KPIs)**\n\nBusiness Metrics link cloud spending to meaningful business outcomes and\nvalue drivers. These KPIs are essential for executives, finance teams,\nand product managers to understand the return on investment (ROI) of\ncloud expenditure and to allocate costs accurately across different\nparts of the organization. They answer the critical question: \"What\nbusiness value are we getting for our cloud spend?\" Examples include:\n\n* **Cost per customer:** Attributes a portion of the total platform cost\n  to each of the company's end customers. This is a powerful metric for\n  understanding profitability and cost-to-serve at a customer level.\n* **Cost per project:** Allocates cloud costs to specific internal\n  projects, products, or initiatives. This enables accurate\n  project-based accounting and helps assess the financial viability of\n  new features or services.\n* **\"Bring Your Own Metric\":** Custom define unit economic metrics that\n  are unique to your organization's business model. Examples could\n  include Cost per Transaction, Cost per Shipment, or Cost per Ad\n  Impression. Creating these tailored metrics ensures the most accurate\n  alignment between cloud spend and core business value.\n\nIf Snowflake is in the value chain for orders, the cost per order can be a good metric to tie Snowflake consumption to Business Demand Drivers.\n\n**Visualize metrics with Snowsight tools and external BI tools**\n\nA critical component of cost governance is the effective visualization\nof spending and usage data. Raw data, while comprehensive, is often\ndifficult to interpret and act upon. By translating cost and usage\nmetrics into interactive dashboards and reports, you can empower\nstakeholders\u2014from engineers to executives\u2014to understand spending\npatterns, troubleshoot, and make informed decisions. A multi-layered\napproach can be used to track meaningful cost metrics.\n\n* **Snowsight's built-in cost management capabilities:** Snowsight\n  provides pre-built visuals for usage and credit monitoring directly\n  within the [Snowflake Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) .\n  It allows filtering by tags (e.g., view cost by department tag),\n  credit consumption by object types, and cost insights to optimize the\n  platform.\n* **Creating custom dashboards or Streamlit apps for different stakeholder groups:** Snowsight facilitates the creation of custom\n  dashboards using ACCOUNT\\_USAGE and ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE views. Custom\n  charts in the Dashboards feature and Streamlit apps can both be easily\n  shared. Combined with cost allocation and tagging, this allows for\n  tailored views for finance managers (aggregated spend), engineering\n  managers (warehouse utilization), or data analysts (query\n  performance).\n* **Integrating with third-party BI tools for advanced analytics:** Connecting to Snowflake from tools like Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or\n  custom applications offers highly customizable and extensive control\n  over cost data visualization. Cloud-specific third-party data programs\n  (FinOps platforms) offer easier setup and more out-of-the-box\n  Snowflake cost optimization insights.\n* **Leverage Cortex Code (In Preview):** This AI Assistant capability\n  allows users to query cost and usage data in ACCOUNT\\_USAGE views using\n  natural language natively in the Snowsight UI.\n\n#### Investigate anomalous consumption activity\n\nCost Anomaly Detection is a critical component of visibility that\nleverages machine learning to continuously monitor credit consumption\nagainst historical spending patterns, automatically flagging significant\ndeviations from the established baseline. This proactive monitoring is\nessential for preventing budget overruns and identifying inefficiencies,\nshifting the organization from a reactive to a proactive cost management\nposture to mitigate financial risk. As a best practice, you should\ninitially review anomaly detection on the entire account to gain a broad\nview, then dive deeper into a more granular review for individual\nhigh-spend warehouses. [This approach](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies) allows for more targeted analysis and assigns clear ownership for\ninvestigating any flagged anomalies. There are several methods for\nanomaly detection supported by Snowflake:\n\n**Cost Anomalies in Snowsight**\n\nSnowsight, Snowflake's primary web interface, offers a dedicated Cost\nManagement UI that allows users to visually identify and analyze the\ndetails of any detected cost anomaly. The importance of this intuitive\nvisual interface lies in its ability to make complex cost data\naccessible to a wide range of stakeholders, enabling rapid root cause\nanalysis by correlating a cost spike with specific query history or user\nactivity. One of the tabs in this UI is the Cost Anomaly Detection tab,\nwhich enables you to view cost anomalies at the organization or account\nlevel and explore the top warehouses or accounts driving this change. To\nfoster a culture of cost awareness and accountability, it is a best\npractice to ensure there is an owner for an anomaly detected in the\naccount and set up a [notification (via email)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-ui) in the UI itself to ensure that cost anomalies are quickly and\naccurately investigated.\n\n**Programmatic Cost Anomaly Detection**\n\nFor deeper integration and automation, organizations can review [anomalies programmatically](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-class) using the SQL functions and views available within the SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL\nschema. This approach is important for enabling automation and\nscalability, allowing cost governance to be embedded directly into\noperational workflows, such as feeding anomaly data into third-party\nobservability tools or triggering automated incident response playbooks.\nA key best practice is to utilize this programmatic access to build\ncustom reports and dashboards that align with specific financial\nreporting needs and to create advanced, automated alerting mechanisms\nthat pipe anomaly data into established operational channels, such as\nSlack or PagerDuty.\n\n**Custom Anomaly Detection & Notification**\n\nAlthough anomalies are detected at the account and organization level,\nif you desire to detect anomalies at lower levels (e.g. warehouse or\ntable), it is recommended to leverage Snowflake\u2019s [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) ML class and pair it with a Snowflake [alert](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) to notify owners of more granular anomalies that occur within the\necosystem. This ensures all levels of Snowflake cost can be monitored in\na proactive and effective way. As a best practice, [notifications](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/notifications/about-notifications) should be configured for a targeted distribution list that includes the\nbudget owner, the FinOps team, and the technical lead responsible for\nthe associated Snowflake resources, ensuring all stakeholders are\nimmediately aware of a potential cost overrun and can coordinate a swift\nresponse.\n\n## Control\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Control principle of the Cost Optimization framework is designed to\nmove organizations beyond cost reporting by establishing the necessary\nautomated guardrails and governance policies to manage and secure\nSnowflake consumption proactively. This framework enforces financial\ngovernance by transforming cost visibility into tangible action,\nutilizing features like budgets and resource monitors to prevent\nuncontrolled growth and ensure consumption aligns strictly with\norganizational financial policies. Control is foundational for\nmaximizing the value of the platform by ensuring disciplined and\ncost-effective resource utilization.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nImplementing a comprehensive control framework, supported by features\nsuch as Resource Monitors, Budgets, and Tagging Policies, empowers\norganizations to enforce financial accountability and maintain budget\npredictability. By adopting these controls, teams can actively manage\nspend, quickly and automatically mitigate cost inefficiencies, and\nensure the disciplined, cost-effective utilization of the entire\nSnowflake environment. The culmination of all of these controls leads to\ngreater platform ROI and minimized financial risk. To meet this goal,\nconsider the following recommendations based on industry best practices\nand Snowflake's capabilities:\n\n#### Proactively monitor all platform usage\n\nTo effectively manage and [control Snowflake spend](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling) ,\nit is essential to establish and enforce cost guardrails. Implementing a [budgeting system](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) is a key\nFinOps practice that promotes cost accountability and optimizes resource\nusage by providing teams with visibility into their consumption and the\nability to set alerts and automated actions. Budgeting helps to prevent\nunexpected cost overruns and encourages a cost-conscious culture.\n\n**Set budgets permissions**\n\nTo establish effective budgets, it's crucial to define [roles and privileges](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) by configuring the role, team, or user responsible for the resources.\nThis ensures that budget tracking aligns with specific business units or\nprojects, enabling accurate cost attribution and accountability. By\nlinking consumption to the relevant stakeholders, you can create a clear\nshowback or chargeback model, which is vital for fostering a sense of\nownership over spending. This configuration should be part of a broader,\nconsistent tagging strategy to ensure all costs are properly allocated\nto departments, environments, or projects.\n\n**Create budget categories**\n\nCategorizing costs is fundamental for granular budget management. You\ncan establish budgets based on the [account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/account-budget) or create [custom categories](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/custom-budget) using Object Tags. Custom tags, such as those for a data product or cost\ncenter, are critical for accurately apportioning costs across different\ndepartments, lines of business, or specific projects. This granular\napproach provides a detailed breakdown of where spending occurs,\nenabling more precise control and informed decision-making regarding\nresource allocation. Implementing robust tagging policies and naming\nconventions ensures consistency and facilitates the interpretation of\ncost data. Because budgets are soft limit objects, objects can be part\nof more than one budget if different perspectives need to be tracked for\ncost (e.g., cost center & workload level budgeting).\n\n**Implement a notification strategy**\n\nEffective budget management relies on timely communication. Setting up\nalerting through emails or webhooks to collaboration tools like Slack\nand Microsoft Teams provides proactive [notification](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/notifications) to key stakeholders when spending approaches or exceeds a defined\nthreshold. These alerts provide teams with an opportunity to review and\nadjust their usage before it leads to significant cost overruns. This\ncapability positions organizations for security success by mitigating\npotential threats through comprehensive monitoring and detection.\n\nNotifications are not limited to just budgets; [Snowflake alerts](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/alerts) can also be\nconfigured to systematically notify administrators of unusual or costly\npatterns, such as those listed in the Control and Optimize sections of\nthe Cost Pillar. This ensures that key drivers of Snowflake consumption\ncan be tracked and remediated proactively, even as the platform\u2019s usage\ngrows.\n\n#### Forecast consumption based on business needs\n\nForecasting Snowflake consumption should be a strategic business\nfunction, not a mere technical prediction. The goal is to establish a\ntransparent basis for budgeting and optimizing ROI by linking\nconsumption directly to measurable business outcomes. In a dynamic,\nusage-based environment where compute costs are the most volatile\nelement of the bill, a robust framework must integrate quantitative\nanalysis of historical usage with qualitative insights into future\nbusiness drivers. The following framework outlines how to build and\nmaintain a comprehensive consumption forecast.\n\n**Establish the Baseline**\n\nThis phase focuses on understanding the source of spend and establishing\ngranular cost accountability.\n\n* **Identify demand drivers and unit economics:** To understand what\n  drives Snowflake spend, correlate historical credit, storage, and data\n  transfer usage with key business metrics like cost per customer or per\n  transaction. Use Snowflake's [ACCOUNT\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) schema, including the WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY and QUERY\\_HISTORY\n  views, as the primary data sources for this analysis.\n* **Granular cost attribution:** Accurately tie costs back to business\n  teams or workloads by implementing a mandatory tagging strategy for\n  all warehouses and queries. Align these tags with your organization's\n  financial structure to provide clear cost segmentation.\n\n**Build the predictive model**\n\nThis phase integrates historical trends with strategic business inputs\nto create forward-looking projections.\n\n* **Historical trend analysis:** Analyze past usage for trends,\n  seasonality, and outliers to inform future projections. Start with\n  simple trend-based forecasting and progressively move to more\n  sophisticated models, leveraging Snowflake\u2019s built-in [SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/forecasting) for time-series forecasting.\n* **Driver-based forecasting:** Integrate planned business initiatives\n  and new projects directly into the model. Collaborate with business\n  leaders to gather strategic inputs such as projected customer growth,\n  new product launches, or increased data ingestion from marketing\n  campaigns.\n* **Scenario modeling:** Develop multiple forecast scenarios (e.g.,\n  \"conservative,\" \"base case,\" \"aggressive\") by applying varied growth\n  factors to key business drivers. This enables flexible planning and\n  helps mitigate financial risk.\n\n**Operationalize and optimize**\n\nThis phase links the forecast to continuous monitoring, governance, and\nproactive cost controls.\n\n* **Continuous monitoring and variance analysis:** Regularly compare\n  actual consumption against the forecast to identify and investigate\n  significant variances. This feedback loop is crucial for refining the\n  underlying model and adapting to evolving business needs.\n* **Collaborative governance:** Ensure a single source of truth for\n  consumption data by establishing a regular FinOps review session with\n  Finance, Engineering, and Business teams. Use customized dashboards to\n  present data in business-friendly terms.\n* **Implement predictive budget controls:** Shift from reactive spending\n  to a proactive model. Utilize Snowflake Resource Monitors and Budgets,\n  which employ monthly-level time-series forecasting, to define credit\n  quotas and trigger automated alerts or suspensions to prevent cost\n  overruns.\n\n#### Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources\n\nTo effectively manage Snowflake expenditure and prevent unforeseen\ncosts, it is crucial to implement a robust framework of resource\ncontrols. These controls act as automated guardrails, ensuring that\nresource consumption for compute, storage, and other services aligns\nwith your financial governance policies. By proactively setting policies\nand remediating inefficiencies, you can maintain budget predictability\nand maximize the value of your investment in the platform.\n\n**Compute controls**\n\nControlling compute consumption is often the most critical aspect of\nSnowflake cost management, as it typically represents the largest\nportion of spend. Snowflake offers several features to manage warehouse\nusage and prevent excessive costs.\n\n* **Implement resource monitors** : [Resource monitors](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) are a powerful feature for tracking and controlling credit consumption\n  across virtual warehouses or for the entire account. Their primary\n  importance lies in their ability to enforce strict budget limits,\n  preventing cost overruns by automatically [triggering actions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) ,\n  such as sending notifications and/or suspending warehouses when credit\n  usage reaches a defined quota. For effective governance, it is a best\n  practice to create multiple resource monitors at different\n  granularities (e.g., per-department, per-project) with escalating\n  actions, such as notifying administrators at 80% usage and suspending\n  all assigned warehouses at 100% usage, to cap spending. It is also\n  considered best practice to ensure there is a consistent action tied\n  to the resource monitors based on your organization\u2019s ways of working.\n  For example, it is worth considering that set resource monitors\n  perform actions like notify to specific admin(s) within your\n  organization.\n* **Reduce Runaway Queries:** Runaway or hung queries can lead to\n  significant cost overruns. Managing long-running queries is especially\n  important for environments with ad-hoc users or complex analytical\n  workloads, where a poorly written query can consume credits for hours.\n  \n    + **Statement timeout policies** automatically terminate any query\n        that runs longer than a specified time limit. This serves as an\n        essential guardrail to prevent individual queries from consuming\n        excessive resources and impacting both cost and performance for\n        other users. The best practice is to set the [STATEMENT\\_TIMEOUT\\_IN\\_SECONDS parameter](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling-controls) at different levels\u2014for the account, warehouse, specific users, or\n        individual sessions\u2014to tailor controls to different workload\n        patterns, such as allowing longer timeouts for ETL warehouses\n        compared to BI warehouses. [Queued timeout policies](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling-controls) can also help remove queries that eclipse a reasonable time\n        threshold and could have been run elsewhere by users trying to\n        receive a response.\n    + **Policy-based automation** can also cancel queries pre-emptively.\n        An example is using stored procedures that leverage the [SYSTEM$CANCEL\\_QUERY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_cancel_query) function to terminate statements that exceed predefined runtime\n        thresholds or contain ill-advised logic, such as exploding joins.\n        This approach allows you to more finely customize the types of\n        queries you want to cancel, as you have full control over defining\n        the stored procedure logic.\n* **Auto-suspend policies** : Auto-suspend policies are a foundational\n  cost control for virtual warehouses, automatically suspending a\n  warehouse after a defined period of inactivity. By default, all\n  warehouses have auto-suspend enabled, however this feature can be\n  disabled, so it\u2019s important to [monitor warehouse auto-suspend configuration](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) and ensure proper access controls are set to restrict users from disabling the auto-suspend setting. The best practice for balancing cost versus performance is to reduce the auto-suspend policy to the minimum possible (generally above 60 seconds) without affecting query caching and performance (SLA) expectations.\n\n**Storage Controls**\n\nWhile storage costs are generally lower than compute costs, they can\ngrow significantly over time. Understanding the different components of\nstorage cost and implementing policies to manage the types of storage is\nkey to keeping these costs in check.\n\n* **Staged files:** [Staged](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-stage) files are files that have been prepped for bulk data loading/unloading\n  (stored in compressed or uncompressed format). They can be stored in\n  an [external stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-create-stage) using cloud provider\u2019s blob storage (such as Amazon S3) or an [internal stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-create-stage) within the Snowflake platform. You are only charged for data stored in\n  internal stages.\n  \n+ To help control costs on staged files, as well as improve\n        performance of data loads, you can ensure successfully ingested\n        files are removed by using the PURGE = TRUE option of the [COPY INTO <table>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) command . Alternatively, use the [REMOVE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/remove) command to remove the files in the stage.\n* **Active Storage:** [Active Storage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/info-schema/table_storage_metrics) consists of the data in a table that can be actively queried against\n  at the current point of time (i.e., without using Time-Travel\n  commands) **.** To control active storage costs, you can create a [Storage Lifecyle Policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/storage-lifecycle-policy/storage-lifecycle-policies) to automatically archive or delete data based on an expiration policy\n  you create.\n* **Time Travel:** [Time Travel](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) data is data that is maintained for all historical changes of a table\n  through its retention time, allowing for easy recovery of changed or\n  deleted data.\n  \n    + Time Travel data retention is controlled using the [DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) parameter , which can be set at a number of different object\n        levels (i.e. Account, Database, Schema, Table), so it is important\n        to monitor this setting to ensure you do not have excessive data\n        retention where it is not needed.\n    + Snowflake has a standard [data retention period](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) of one day. This is automatically enabled for all accounts, but for some tables, particularly [large, high churn tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-storage-considerations) , this one day can still result in excessive costs. To reduce costs in these cases, you can create these tables as transient with zero Time Travel retention (i.e., DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS=0) and periodically insert a copy of the table contents into a permanent table.\n* **Fail-safe:** In addition to Time-Travel, Snowflake retains\n  historical data for seven days after the Time-Travel retention period\n  expires as [Fail-Safe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-failsafe) data. This data can be requested for worst-case scenario data\n  recovery. Fail-safe applies to all tables that are created as the\n  permanent [table type](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) (which is the default table type).\n  \n+ However, for ETL or data modeling, it is common to have tables that\n        are created on a short-term basis to support transformations. For\n        these use cases, it is recommended that you use [Temporary and Transient tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-cdp-storage-costs) ,\n        which do not utilize fail-safe storage and thus do not incur\n        additional storage costs.\n* **Retained for clones:** This is data that is stored because it is\n  referenced by a clone, despite the data being deleted or outside the\n  retention period of the base table that was cloned. To control costs\n  related to these \u201cstale\u201d clones, it is recommended that you monitor [RETAINED\\_FOR\\_CLONE\\_BYTES](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-to-manage-RETAINED-FOR-CLONE-BYTES) and drop clones that are no longer needed. You can leverage the [Alerts and Notifications features](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-alerts) to alert you when RETAINED\\_FOR\\_CLONE\\_BYTES exceeds a threshold, prompting you to take action.\n\n**Serverless Features**\n\nFor serverless features, which do not use warehouse compute and\ntherefore cannot leverage the Resource Monitor feature, we recommend\nsetting up a budget. [Budgets](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) allow\nyou to define a monthly spending limit on the [compute costs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute) for a Snowflake account or a custom group of Snowflake objects. When the\nspending limit is projected to be hit, a notification is sent. While\nBudgets do not explicitly allow you to suspend serverless features upon\nreaching a limit (the way that Resource Monitors do), Budgets can be\nconfigured to not only send emails, but also send [notifications](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/notifications) to a cloud message queue or other webhooks (such as Microsoft Teams,\nSlack, or PagerDuty). This then gives you the ability to trigger other\nactions for remediation.\n\n#### Govern resource creation and administration\n\nTo prevent uncontrolled spend as organizations scale, it's essential to\nhave a clear management strategy for Snowflake resources, most notably,\nvirtual warehouses. This strategy should encompass a defined\nprovisioning process, ongoing object management, and automated platform\nenforcement to foster agility while maintaining financial discipline.\n\n**Centralized vs. decentralized management**\n\nOrganizations tend to adopt one of two primary approaches to managing\nSnowflake resources:\n\n* **Centralized management:** A dedicated team, such as a platform\n  Center of Excellence (CoE), handles resource creation and\n  administration policies. This ensures consistency, adheres to best\n  practices, and facilitates robust cost control. This model is ideal\n  for large enterprises where strict governance and chargeback are\n  paramount.\n* **Decentralized management:** Individual business units or teams\n  manage their own resources. This provides greater autonomy and speed\n  but can lead to resource sprawl, inconsistent practices, and\n  significant cost inefficiencies if not properly governed.\n\n**Striking the balance: the federated model**\n\nThe most effective strategy often lies in a hybrid, or federated, model.\nThis approach combines centralized governance (policies defined by a\nCoE) with decentralized execution (teams having the freedom to create\nresources within those guardrails). This balance enables agility while\nmitigating financial risk.\n\n**Core Principles for Governance**\n\nRegardless of the chosen model, these principles are essential for\neffective governance:\n\n* **Limit resource creation:** Restrict the ability to create or modify\n  virtual warehouses and other high-cost resources to a small number of\n  trusted roles to prevent uncontrolled growth.\n* **Establish a transparent workflow:** Create a clear, simple workflow\n  for provisioning resources, especially for larger warehouses. For\n  example, any request for a warehouse of medium size or larger should\n  require a business justification and an assigned cost center.\n* **Near real-time visibility:** Triggered visibility is non-negotiable\n  for monitoring resource creation and resizing. Configure alerts that\n  notify FinOps or CoE teams whenever a new warehouse is created or an\n  existing one is modified outside of a provisioning workflow. This\n  allows for immediate review and prevents overprovisioning.\n* **Enforce tagging:** Make a mandatory tagging strategy a prerequisite\n  for all resource creation. This ensures every credit spent can be\n  accurately attributed to the correct department or project, enabling\n  robust chargeback and accountability.\n* **Automate deactivation:** To prevent object sprawl, implement\n  policies that identify and deactivate stale resources after a\n  predetermined period of disuse.\n\n## Optimize\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Optimization principle of the Cost Optimization framework focuses on continuously improving the efficiency of your Snowflake resources. This includes optimizing compute, storage, data transfer, and managed services by understanding their usage and identifying areas for improvement. The frequency of optimization efforts should be guided by the metrics established in the Visibility principle and monitored through the Control principle. All recommendations within this Optimize principle are to be reviewed on a regular cadence and balanced with business and performance needs.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nSnowflake offers numerous optimization controls within its platform.\nThese features are designed to enhance efficiency and reduce\nadministrative overhead for your various workloads. Coupled with\noperational best practices that utilize features in a healthy manner,\nyou can balance performance goals with cost governance requirements to\nmeet business objectives.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you will be able to:\n\n* Reduce administration time\n* Increase workload efficiency\n* Balance cost controls and guardrails to meet service level agreements\n  and business objectives\n* Achieve healthy growth and economies of scale within your organization\n\nTo foster healthy growth and achieve economies of scale within your\norganization, we recommend the following, drawing upon industry best\npractices and Snowflake's capabilities.\n\n#### Compute workload-aligned provisioning\n\nCompute is the most significant part of any organization\u2019s Snowflake\nspend, typically accounting for 80% or more of spend. A good warehouse\ndesign should incorporate the principles below:\n\n* Separate warehouses by workload (e.g., ELT versus analytics versus\n  data science)\n* Workload size in bytes should match the t-shirt size of the warehouse\n  in the majority of the workloads\u2013larger warehouse size doesn\u2019t always\n  mean faster\n* Align warehouse size for optimal cost-performance settings\n* [Utilize Multi-Cluster Warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) configuration to solve for high concurrency\n* Utilize [Query Acceleration Services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) to help with infrequent, large data scans\n* For memory-intensive workloads, use a warehouse type of Snowpark\n  Optimized or higher memory resource constraint configurations as\n  appropriate\n* Set appropriate auto-suspend settings - longer for high cache use,\n  lower for no cache reuse\n* Set appropriate warehouse query timeout settings for the workload and\n  the use cases it supports.\n\nUsing the principles above ensures that your compute costs are well\nmanaged and balanced with optimal benefits.\n\n**Separate warehouses by workload**\n\nDifferent workloads (e.g., data engineering, analytics, AI and\napplications) have varying characteristics. [Separating these to be serviced by different virtual warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) can help ensure relevant features in Snowflake can be utilized.\n\nSome examples of this include:\n\n* Optimize dashboards and reports by [reusing the warehouse SSD cache](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) for repeated select queries. This can be achieved by configuring a\n  longer warehouse autosuspend setting.\n* Loading large volumes of data using [optimal file sizes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-prepare) and utilizing all available threads in a virtual warehouse\n* Processing large data sets for AI workloads using memory-optimized\n  warehouses\n\n**Warehouse sizing**\n\nMapping the workload to the [right warehouse size](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-warehouse-size) and configuration is an important consideration of warehouse design.\nThis should consider several factors like query completion time,\ncomplexity, data size, query volume, SLAs, queuing, and balancing\noverall cost objectives. Warehouse sizing involves a cost-benefit\nanalysis that balances performance, cost, and human expectations. Humans\noften have expectations that their queries will not be queued or take a\nlong time to complete, so it is recommended to have dedicated warehouses\nfor teams.\n\nRecommendations for choosing the right-sized warehouse include:\n\n* Follow the principles outlined above and understand that this is a\n  continuous improvement process.\n* Choose a size based on the estimated or actual workload size and\n  monitor.\n* Utilize Snowflake's extensive telemetry data, such as [QUERY\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history) and [WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/warehouse_metering_history) ,\n  to validate that the warehouse size is impacting the metrics you care\n  about in the direction you intend.\n\n**Optimal warehouse settings**\n\nWhile Snowflake strives for minimal knobs and self-managed tuning, there\nare situations where selecting the right settings for warehouses can\nhelp with optimal cost and/or performance. Some of the key [warehouse settings](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse) include\n\n* Auto suspend\n* Multi-cluster settings\n* Warehouse resource constraints\n* Warehouse type\n\nTo maintain an optimal balance between cost and performance, regularly\nmonitor your resource usage (e.g., weekly or monthly) and set up\nresource monitors to alert you to high credit consumption. When workload\ndemands change, adjust your settings as needed.\n\n**Warehouse consolidation**\n\nIf you find yourself with an excess of provisioned warehouses or a shift\nin workloads necessitating consolidation, apply the aforementioned\nprinciples. Begin with the least utilized warehouses and migrate their\nworkloads to an existing warehouse that handles similar tasks.\n\nThe [WAREHOUSE\\_LOAD\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/warehouse_load_history) view can help you assess the average number of queries running on a\nwarehouse over a specific period. A useful benchmark is to aim for a\nwarehouse running queries 80% of the time it's active. Continuously\nmonitor your key metrics to ensure they still meet SLA goals and adjust\nwarehouse settings as needed.\n\n#### Leverage Managed Services\n\nTo achieve significant operational efficiency and predictable costs,\nprioritize the use of serverless and managed services. These services\neliminate the need to manage underlying compute infrastructure, allowing\nyour organization to pay for results rather than resource provisioning\nand scaling. Evaluate the following servterless features to reduce costs\nand enhance performance in your environment.\n\n**Storage optimization**\n\nSnowflake offers several serverless features that automatically [manage and optimize your tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-storage) ,\nreducing the need for manual intervention while improving query\nperformance. The following features ensure your data is efficiently\norganized, allowing for faster and more cost-effective qeuerying without\nthe burden of user management.\n\n**Automatic Clustering** is a background process in Snowflake that\norganizes data within a table by sorting it according to predefined\ncolumns. This process is critical for optimizing query performance and\nreducing costs. Benefits include:\n\n* **Improved query pruning:** By sorting data, automatic clustering\n  enables more effective pruning in SQL WHERE clauses, meaning less data\n  needs to be scanned for a given query.\n* **Faster joins:** Clustering also results in quicker and more\n  efficient join operations.\n* **Cost-efficient queries:** These benefits ultimately result in faster\n  and more cost-effective query execution.\n\n**Considerations and Best Practices:**\n\n* **Careful tuning:** It's essential to tune automatic clustering\n  carefully. Overuse of clustering keys, use of highly selective keys,\n  or frequent data manipulation language (DML) operations can\n  significantly increase clustering costs.\n* **Infrequently queried, frequently updated tables:** Exercise caution\n  with tables that are often updated but rarely queried, as clustering\n  costs may outweigh performance improvements.\n* **Cost estimation:** Before enabling, estimate clustering costs for a\n  table using Snowflake's system function for a preliminary cost/benefit\n  analysis.\n* **Strategic cluster key selection:** Optimizing clustering key\n  selection is vital to strike a balance between cost and performance.\n\n**Search Optimization Service (SOS)** enhances the performance of point\nlookup searches by creating a persistent search access path. Its primary\nvalue lies in achieving better pruning for these specific query types,\nwhich is critical for applications requiring quick response times. They\ncan be used in combination with auto-clustering and [Snowflake Optima service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-optima) .\n\n**Considerations for SOS:**\n\n* **Excessive indexed columns:** Avoid having too many indexed columns,\n  especially on high-churn tables, as maintenance costs can become\n  substantial.\n* **Inefficient cost-benefit ratio:** Tables that are frequently updated\n  but infrequently queried for point lookups can lead to an inefficient\n  cost/benefit ratio.\n* **Cost estimation:** Before enabling, estimate SOS costs on a given\n  table using a Snowflake system function to perform a preliminary\n  cost/benefit analysis. Index selection is crucial for balancing\n  performance and cost, a topic also addressed in the Workload\n  Optimization section.\n\n**Materialized Views (MVs)** are pre-computed query results stored as a\nseparate table and automatically maintained by Snowflake.\n\n**Benefits of MVs:**\n\n* **Cost efficiency:** It is often cheaper to update a materialized view\n  than to repeatedly execute full scans of large, complex base tables.\n* **Alternative table order:** MVs can provide an alternative table\n  order for queries that do not align with your existing clustering\n  design.\n\n**Considerations for MVs:**\n\n* **Infrequently queried, frequently updated tables:** Avoid creating\n  materialized views on tables that are frequently updated but rarely\n  queried, as automated maintenance costs will negate any potential\n  query cost savings.\n* **Clustering differences:** Be aware of clustering differences between\n  the base table and the materialized view, as this can lead to high\n  maintenance costs.\n\n**[Query Acceleration Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) (QAS):** QAS is a serverless feature that provides a burst of additional\ncompute resources to accelerate specific parts of a query, rather than\nreplacing an appropriately sized warehouse. It's particularly beneficial\nfor large I/O operation queries, eliminating the need to manually scale\nwarehouses up or down. QAS also helps speed up query execution when\ntable clustering cannot be altered due to other workload dependencies. A\ncost-benefit analysis should always be performed to ensure that the\ncredit consumption from QAS is justified by the performance improvement\nand the avoided cost of a larger warehouse.\n\n**Serverless tasks:** Serverless tasks enable the execution of SQL\nstatements or stored procedures on a user-defined schedule, eliminating\nthe need for a user-managed virtual warehouse. This is a cost-effective\nsolution for infrequent workloads where a warm cache offers minimal\nvalue, or for unpredictable workloads that don't utilize a minimum\n60-second usage.\n\n#### Data storage types & lifecycle management\n\nNext to compute, storage often represents the second-highest cost\ncomponent in Snowflake. Effective storage governance is a critical\nconcern for many industries due to federal and global regulations.\nSnowflake's default settings prioritize maximum data protection, which\nmay not always align with the requirements of every workload or\nenvironment. This section focuses on how to manage and configure\nstorage-related settings appropriately, ensuring that storage costs\nremain reasonable and deliver business value.\n\n**Optimizing table volume and auditing usage**\n\n* **Review policy-driven data lifecycle management:**\n  \n    + **Time Travel & Fail-safe:** Set the [DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters) parameter on a per-table or per-schema basis to the minimum required\n        for your business needs. For transient data, use [TRANSIENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) tables to eliminate Fail-safe costs.\n    + **Retained for clone:** Be mindful of cloning operations. While\n        zero-copy cloning is cost-effective initially, any subsequent DML\n        (Data Manipulation Language) operations on the clone will create new\n        micro-partitions, increasing storage costs. It is recommended to\n        drop clones when they are no longer needed.\n* **Be aware of high-churn tables:**\n  \n+ If a table is updated consistently, inactive storage (Time Travel &\n        Fail-safe data) can grow at a much faster rate than active storage.\n        A high churn table is generally characterized as one that has 40% or\n        more of its storage inactive. Therefore, aligning both the retention\n        time and the use of an appropriate table type with business and\n        recovery requirements is paramount to keeping costs under control.\n        Review High Churn tables on a consistent basis to ensure their\n        configuration is as desired.\n* **Proactively clean up unused objects:**\n  \n    + **Large tables that are never queried:** Establish a process to\n        identify, rename, and eventually drop tables that have not been\n        queried for an extended period. You can use the [ACCESS\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/access-history) account usage view to review the last time a table was selected\n        from. Snowflake\u2019s [Cost Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) will also check weekly for unused tables on your behalf.\n    + **Short-lived permanent tables:** For staging or intermediate data\n        that is rebuilt frequently, use [TRANSIENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) or [TEMPORARY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) tables instead of permanent tables to avoid unnecessary Time Travel\n        and Fail-safe storage fees.\n* **Perform catalog & stage management:**\n  \n+ **Data archiving:** For historical data that is rarely accessed,\n        consider moving it to cooler tiers with [storage lifecycle policies](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/storage-lifecycle-policy/storage-lifecycle-policies) or deleting it altogether.\n\n**Optimizing Managed Data Structures and Access**\n\n* You do not always need to define cluster keys for all tables (unlike\n  many other relational database management systems) if Snowflake's\n  natural data loading maintains consistent micro-partition min/max\n  values relative to your query patterns. Additionally, you can disable\n  Auto-Clustering on a table while keeping its cluster key definition\n  without incurring extra costs.\n* **Infrequently used materialized views and search optimization paths:** Materialized Views and search optimization paths can incur\n  unnecessary storage and compute costs if they are no longer actively\n  utilized. Materialized Views are most effective for stable data tables\n  with repeated complex aggregations or joins, while search optimization\n  is designed for high-speed point lookup queries. Snowflake\u2019s [Cost Insights feature](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) can help identify instances where these objects are rarely used,\n  prompting a review to determine if their performance benefits still\n  outweigh their associated costs.\n\n#### Limit data transfer\n\nData egress, the transfer of data from one cloud provider or region to\nanother, can incur substantial costs, particularly when handling large\ndata volumes. Implementing appropriate tools and best practices is\nessential to minimize these data transfer expenses and maximize business\nvalue when data egress is necessary.\n\n**Tooling: Enable proactive cost management**\n\nLeverage Snowflake's native features to gain visibility and control over\ndata transfer costs before they become a significant expense.\n\n* **Egress Cost Optimizer (ECO):** For providers of data products on the\n  Snowflake Marketplace or private listings, enabling the [Egress Cost Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) (ECO) at the organizational level is a critical best practice. ECO is\n  an automated feature for listings with Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment.\n  It intelligently routes data through a Snowflake-managed cache,\n  allowing you to pay a one-time egress cost for the initial data\n  transfer. After that, expanding to new regions incurs zero additional\n  egress costs for the same dataset. This is a powerful tool for scaling\n  your data sharing without compounding data transfer fees.\n* **Monitoring and alerts:** To effectively manage data transfer costs,\n  utilize Snowflake's [DATA\\_TRANSFER\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage/data_transfer_history) telemetry view. This view provides detailed insights into data\n  movement between different regions and clouds. Establish dashboards\n  and alerts to meticulously track this usage, enabling prompt detection\n  of any unexpected cost increases.\n\n**Architectural best practices: Design for minimal data movement**\n\nMinimizing data transfer costs for your workloads heavily depends on the\narchitecture of your data pipelines and applications. Adhere to the\nfollowing best practices to achieve this:\n\n* **Unloading Data:**\n  \n    + **Compress data:** When using the [COPY INTO <location>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) command to unload data, always use a compression format (e.g., GZIP,\n        BZIP2, or Brotli). This dramatically reduces the volume of data\n        transferred and directly lowers egress costs.\n    + **Filter before unloading:** Before unloading a large dataset, use\n        SQL to filter and transform the data. Unload only the required\n        columns and rows to minimize the volume of data that must leave the\n        Snowflake environment.\n* **Data replication:** Replicating a database to a Snowflake account in\n  a different geographical region or on a different cloud provider\n  incurs data transfer fees. While useful for disaster recovery, this\n  can become expensive if not managed carefully.\n  \n    + **Targeted replication:** If a full database replica is not\n        required, use [replication groups](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-intro) to replicate only the necessary databases or schemas. This granular\n        approach ensures you only pay for the data you absolutely need to\n        move.\n    + **Consider refresh cadence:** your frequency of refresh will affect\n        the amount of data that is replicated, since it acts like a snapshot\n        rather than every incremental change. Incremental ETL practices are\n        recommended even more with data that is being replicated vs full\n        table reloads.\n* **External network access and functions:**\n  \n    + **Minimize data egress:** [External functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions) and [external network access](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/external-network-access/external-network-access-overview) ,\n        which call remote services (e.g., APIs), transfer data out of\n        Snowflake. For best practice, filter data _before_ sending it to the\n        external service. Avoid writing functions that pass an entire large\n        table as an input; instead, pass only a small, pre-filtered subset.\n    + **Co-locate services:** If possible, deploy the remote service (like\n        an AWS Lambda or Azure Function) in the same cloud and region as\n        your Snowflake account to eliminate cross-region and cross-cloud\n        egress fees.\n* **Cross-cloud auto-fulfillment:**\n  \n+ **Embrace the cache:** As a data provider, enable [Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment) for your listings. As mentioned under Tooling, this feature\n        automates the replication process and works in conjunction with the\n        Egress Cost Optimizer to ensure you pay a single, upfront cost for\n        data transfer, even as your data product expands to new regions.\n* **Cross-region/cross-cloud Iceberg storage:**\n  \n+ **Centralize your catalog:** While Snowflake supports [Iceberg tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-iceberg-storage) that are external to its managed storage, be mindful of where the\n        data resides. If your Snowflake account and your Iceberg data are in\n        different regions, querying the Iceberg table will result in egress\n        costs from your cloud provider. For a well-architected solution,\n        keep your Iceberg data and your Snowflake account in the same region\n        to avoid these egress charges.\n\n#### Workload optimization\n\nWorkload optimization focuses on identifying the efficiency of your data\nprocessing activities within Snowflake. This involves a holistic\napproach encompassing the review of query syntax, data pipelines, table\nstructures, and warehouse configurations to minimize resource\nconsumption and improve performance. By addressing inefficiencies across\nthese areas, organizations can significantly reduce costs and accelerate\ndata delivery.\n\n**Query syntax optimization**\n\nInefficient queries often lead to excessive and hidden credit\nconsumption. Organizations can identify performance bottlenecks and\nunderstand the cost impact of specific SQL patterns by using Snowflake\nfeatures and adhering to SQL code best practices. This enables\ndevelopment teams to create more efficient and cost-effective code by\nhighlighting poor performing queries. Refer to the Performance\nOptimization Pillar of the Snowflake Well-Architected Framework for\ndetails on how to do this.\n\n**Utilize query history & insights for highlevel monitoring**\n\nFor broader visibility across all workloads, the Snowsight UI and the\nACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema are indispensable.\n\n* When looking for opportunities to improve, it is best to look for\n  queries that have excessive execution time across similarly run\n  queries. The newly created [Grouped Query History](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) aggregates queries to their [parameterized query hash](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-hash) and allows users to sort based on key performance indicators like\n  total queries, total latency, bytes scanned, and drill down into the\n  query execution across time. It is recommended to start with queries\n  with outsized latency and query runs.\n* The [Query History](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) page in Snowsight provides a high-level, filterable view of past and\n  currently running queries. It allows for you to drill into the Query\n  Profile for individual query statistics and investigation, even while\n  the query is running.\n* Snowflake's [Query Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-insights) feature (both a set of account usage tables and query profile\n  attributes) are also in Snowsight and can easily surface queries that\n  would benefit from optimization, such as queries with exploding joins\n  or ineffective filtering criteria that Snowflake will surface on your\n  behalf.\n\n**Leverage the query profile for deep-dive analysis**\n\nAfter identifying problematic queries, the [Query Profile](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) is an essential tool for understanding the execution plan of a query. It\nprovides a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of every operator involved,\nfrom data scanning to final result delivery. To gain visibility into\ninefficiencies, analysts and developers should regularly use the Query\nProfile to identify common anti-patterns like:\n\n* **Nodes with high execution time:** Pinpoint specific operations\n  (e.g., a complex join or a sort operation) that consume the majority\n  of the query's execution time.\n* **\"Exploding\" joins:** Identify Cartesian products or other\n  inefficient joins that create a much larger number of rows than\n  expected.\n* **Excessive table scanning:** In the profile, compare Partitions\n  scanned to Partitions total. A large number of scanned partitions on a\n  clustered table often indicates an opportunity to improve table\n  pruning by adding or refining cluster keys or modifying WHERE clause\n  predicates.\n* **Data spillage:** Look for operators spilling data to local or remote\n  disk. This indicates that the warehouse memory is insufficient for the\n  operation, resulting in significant performance degradation. This\n  might suggest a need to temporarily increase warehouse size for that\n  specific workload or rewrite the query to consume less memory.\n\n**Programmatically deconstruct queries for automated analysis**\n\nFor advanced use cases and automated monitoring, you can\nprogrammatically access query performance data. The [GET\\_QUERY\\_OPERATOR\\_STATS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/get_query_operator_stats) function can be used to retrieve the granular, operator-level statistics\nfor a given query ID, showing many of the steps and attributes available\nin the query profile view. This allows you to build automated checks\nthat, for instance, flag any query where a full table scan accounts for\nmore than 90% of the execution time or where data spillage exceeds a\ncertain threshold. This approach helps scale performance visibility\nbeyond manual checks.\n\n**Pipeline optimization**\n\nSnowflake pipeline optimization is about designing and managing data\ningestion and transformation processes that are efficient,\ncost-effective, scalable, and low-maintenance, while balancing business\nvalue and SLAs (service levels for freshness and responsiveness). Key\nlevers include architecture patterns (truncate & load versus incremental\nloads), use of serverless managed services (e.g., Snowpipe, Dynamic\nTables), and auditing loading practices to maximize cost and performance\nbenefits.\n\n**Batch loading**\n\nThe COPY INTO\n( [table](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) or [location](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) )\ncommand is a foundational and flexible method for bulk data loading from\nan external stage into a Snowflake table. Its importance lies in its\nrole as a powerful, built-in tool for migrating large volumes of\nhistorical data or loading scheduled batch files. The best practice is\nto use COPY INTO for one-time or large batch data loading jobs, which\ncan then be supplemented with more continuous ingestion methods like\nSnowpipe for incremental data. Additional information regarding COPY\nINTO and general data loading best practices can be found in our\ndocumentation [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/data-load-considerations) .\nSome additional best practices are outlined below.\n\n* **File and batch sizing:** Optimal performance is achieved with files\n  sized 100\u2013250 MB compressed. Too few large files or too many very\n  small files reduce load parallelism and reduce efficiency.\n* **Parallelism:** Size and configure your warehouse cluster to match\n  the number and typical size of files to be loaded. (e.g., an XS\n  warehouse has eight threads; to utilize it fully, you need at least\n  eight files).\n* **File organization:** Partition files in external stages by logical\n  paths (date, region, etc.) to allow selective/cost-effective loads and\n  enable easy partition-level reloading.\n* **Pattern filtering:** Use COPY's pattern and files parameter to\n  precisely select the right files for each load, particularly to avoid\n  scanning entire stages.\n* **Resource management:** Use resource monitors and low auto-suspend\n  settings on load warehouses to minimize idle compute costs. For more\n  information here see our section on Resource Monitors.\\*\\* \\*\\*\n\n**Serverless ingestion**\n\nWhile named similarly, [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro) and [Snowpipe Streaming](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowpipe-streaming/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview) are different serverless methods to ingest data. You would utilize one\nversus the other depending on your SLA requirements for data delivery,\nand based on how data is landing for consumption.\n\n* **Snowpipe (file-based micro-batch ingestion)** : Use Snowpipe for\n  continuous ingestion of files where near real-time availability is\n  acceptable and ingestion frequency is moderate. File size guidance is\n  the same as COPY INTO (100-250MB). This leverages serverless compute\n  to avoid warehouse management overhead.\n* **Snowpipe Streaming (rowset-based, real-time ingestion)** : Use\n  Snowpipe Streaming for very low-latency (sub-five-second) ingestion,\n  high throughput, and streaming sources (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis, and\n  event hubs). You will want to ensure \u201cexactly-once guarantees\u201d with\n  offset tokens for idempotency. Ideally, you would batch insert as much\n  as possible to reduce API call overhead, but avoid building streaming\n  applications just to load large \"batch\" files.\n\n**Data Transformation Optimization**\n\nIn general, there are two major transformation strategies followed in\nSnowflake. One is \u201ctruncate & load,\u201d which involves full data\nreplacement and reloading, and one is incrementally loading new data\ninto an object, possibly requiring an upsert operation. Below is some\ngeneral guidance on when to use each.\n\n* **Truncate & load:** This is utilized when full data replacement is\n  acceptable and the dataset volume/size allows for fast reloads. In\n  this case, data change patterns are such that identifying incremental\n  deltas is expensive or unreliable and downstream consumers can\n  tolerate occasional brief periods of incomplete data (during load).\n  \n+ **Best practices:** Schedule loads during off-peak or agreed \u201cquiet\u201d\n        windows. Consider transient or temporary tables to stage incoming\n        data, maximize parallelism during the load, and then do an atomic\n        swap/rename to minimize downtime. Ensure that you carefully manage\n        object dependencies, constraints, and statistical metadata refresh\n        after reloads to ensure proper performance once data is loaded\n* **Incremental loads:** Incremental loads are best when datasets are\n  large and a full reload is too costly, slow, or would create\n  unacceptable latency. Change-data-capture (CDC), event streaming, or\n  other means are available to reliably identify deltas (inserts,\n  updates, deletes). Additionally, in these cases, downstream consumers\n  require near-continuous data availability or very low data latency and\n  freshness.\n  \n    + **Best practices:** Design pipelines to deduplicate, merge, and\n        correctly apply CDC deltas using staging tables, Streams, and merge\n        operations. Ideally, you use Stream objects on source tables to\n        track changes efficiently if utilizing Streams or Tasks, and use\n        Tasks to automate processing. Dynamic tables are also an option;\n        please see below. Additionally, for batch files: organize files by\n        partitioned paths and use file loading patterns that enable max\n        parallelism (see COPY INTO guidance below).\n    + Test workloads on [Snowflake\u2019s Generation 2 warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-gen2) that incorporate software improvements for data manipulation.\n\nA great example of truncate & load versus incremental can be seen in\nrefresh strategies for [Dynamic Tables (DTs)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-about) .\nThey are also a cost-effective and low-maintenance way to maintain data\npipelines. Dynamic tables provide a powerful, automated way to build\ncontinuous data transformation pipelines with SQL, eliminating the need\nfor manual task orchestration that was historically architected with\nstreams & tasks in Snowflake. [Streams & tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-pipelines-intro) still have their uses, but general guidance and ease of use see more\nSnowflake users leaning towards DTs for automated data pipelines since\nthe pipeline definitions are defined in one object or in a chain of\nobjects.\n\nThe [key concepts of dynamic tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-refresh) are defined in our documentation. However, best practices and\ndetermining when to use DTs versus other methods of pipeline tooling in\nSnowflake still warrant discussion, and are compared in Snowflake\u2019s [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-comparison) .\n\nIn addition to Snowflake\u2019s published [best practices](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-table-performance-guide) ,\nconsider the following\n\n* **Default to AUTO refresh** : Override only as needed for predictable\n  SLAs.\n* **Keep incremental refresh-friendly queries simple:** Avoid complex\n  nested joins, CTEs, and limit the number of outer joins per DT. The\n  introduction of complexity for incremental refresh may result in\n  longer times for execution, which in turn could force Snowflake in\n  AUTO to perform a full refresh rather than incremental.\n* **Incremental refresh is optimal** when less than 5% of the rows\n  change between refresh cycles, and source tables are well clustered by\n  relevant keys.\n* **For very complex/large transformations:** Chain multiple DTs for\n  better incrementalization, rather than building one massive DT.\n* **Monitor actual lag and refresh metrics** to adjust lag or warehouse\n  sizing as cost and response time needs evolve.\n* **Prefer a dedicated warehouse for DT refresh** during pipeline\n  development and cost analysis to isolate consumption, then consider\n  sharing for production.\n* **Use transient DTs** for high-throughput, non-critical staging steps\n  to keep storage costs down.\n* **Avoid non-deterministic functions in incremental DTs** (e.g.,\n  random, volatile UDFs, queries depending on CURRENT\\_USER).\n\nMore information on dynamic tables versus streams & tasks versus\nmaterialized views can be found in the Snowflake documentation [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-comparison) .\n\n**Table pruning optimization**\n\nTable scanning operations are one of the most resource-intensive aspects\nof query execution. Minimizing the scan of data partitions in a table\n(called partition pruning) can provide significant improvements to both\nperformance and cost for data operations in Snowflake. The account usage\nviews [TABLE\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/table_query_pruning_history) and [COLUMN\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/column_query_pruning_history) provide aggregated data on query execution, showing metrics such as\npartitions scanned and rows matched, which helps identify tables with\npoor pruning efficiency. By analyzing this data, you can determine the\nmost frequently accessed columns that are leading to a high number of\nunnecessarily scanned micro-partitions. Common ways to optimize these\naccess patterns are by using Automatic Clustering and Search\nOptimization.\n\nTo determine tables that can most benefit from re-ordering how data is\nstored, you can review Snowflake\u2019s [best practice](https://medium.com/snowflake/supercharging-snowflake-pruning-using-new-account-usage-views-52530b24bf2e) on how to analyze the TABLE\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY and\nCOLUMN\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY account usage views. Fundamentally,\nreducing the percentage of partitions in each table pruned to the\npercentage of rows returned in a query will lead to the most optimized\ncost and performance for any given workload.\n\nA table\u2019s Ideal pruning state is scanning the same % of rows matched as\npartitions read, minimizing unused read rows.\n\n**Warehouse optimization**\n\nWarehouse concurrency, type, and sizing can impact the execution\nperformance and cost of queries within Snowflake. Review the compute\noptimization section for more information into the tuning of the\nwarehouse and its effect on cost and performance.\n\n#### Improve continually\n\nOptimization is a continuous process that ensures all workloads not only\ndrive maximum business value but also do so in an optimal manner. By\nregularly reviewing, analyzing, and refining your Snowflake environment,\nyou can identify inefficiencies, implement improvements, and adapt your\nplatform to the ever-evolving business needs. The following set of steps\nwill help you continue to improve your environment as you grow:\n\n**Step 1: Identify & investigate workloads to improve**\n\nBegin by regularly reviewing (usually on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly\ncadence) workloads that could benefit from optimization, using\nSnowflake's [Cost Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) ,\ndeviations in unit economics or health metrics (from the Visibility\nprinciple), or objects hitting control limits (e.g., queries hitting\nwarehouse timeouts from the Control principle). Once identified,\ninvestigate these findings through the Cost Management UI, Cost Anomaly\ndetection, Query History, or custom dashboards with Account Usage Views\nto pinpoint the root cause. Then, using the recommendations in the\nOptimize Pillar, make improvements to the workload or object.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate & test**\n\nBefore implementing changes, estimate the potential impact on cost and\nperformance. Estimation encompasses both the expected amount of time\nrequired to make a change (for instance, consolidating warehouses will\nnecessitate more coordination effort for teams using the resource than\naltering a configuration setting) as well as the hard cost of\nimplementation. Snowflake provides helpful cost estimation functions for\nserverless features, such as [auto clustering](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_estimate_automatic_clustering_costs) and [search optimization service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_estimate_search_optimization_costs) ,\nto help make this a more data-driven process. If an estimation tool is\nnot available, making changes in a development or test environment on a\nsubset of the workload can provide an estimate and expected impact.\n\n**Step 3: Decide & implement**\n\nBased on your estimations and test results, decide whether to move\nforward with the change, ensuring the cost-benefit aligns with\nperformance or business needs. If approved, proceed to productionize the\nchange, integrating it into your live environment.\n\n**Step 4: Monitor & analyze**\n\nFinally, monitor and analyze the implemented changes to track and\nvalidate the change\u2019s success over a period of time. This involves using\nthe same investigation methods, like utilizing the Cost Management UI\nand Account Usage Views, and comparing cost and performance metrics\nbefore and after the change to articulate the business impact. Translate\nthe technical improvements into tangible business benefits. For example,\n\"Optimizing this query reduced monthly warehouse costs by $X and\nimproved report generation time by Y minutes, allowing business users to\nmake faster decisions.\" This helps to both demonstrate the value of your\noptimization efforts to stakeholders and business value to the company.\nFinally, course-correct as needed depending on the results of the\nmonitoring\n\nThis continual improvement framework is the culmination of all subtopics\nwithin the Cost Optimization Pillar and provides a consistent way for\nyou to grow healthily on Snowflake.\n\nUpdated Nov 24, 2025\n\nThis content is provided as is, and is not maintained on an ongoing basis.

        "Ternary named a Leader in the 2025 ISG Provider Lens\u00ae for FinOps Platforms . [Download the report](https://ternary.app/isg-names-ternary-a-leader/) .\n\n\u2715\n\nBlog\n\n# Top 4 Snowflake cost management tools\n\n**Last updated:** December 10, 2025\n\nTernary Team\n\nSnowflake\u2019s cloud-native design and separation of storage and compute are part of why so many companies adopted it quickly. It lets teams spin up warehouses on demand without worrying about infrastructure management or upfront hardware costs. They can also handle workloads that would crush many traditional databases.\n\nBut this flexibility cuts both ways. The same architecture makes it easy to drive costs up without anyone noticing until the bill arrives.\n\nAnd to prevent overspending, you need detailed visibility. That\u2019s what a Snowflake cost management tool provides. It helps you understand what\u2019s causing overspending while also guiding you on how to trim it.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll introduce you to the 4 best Snowflake cost management tools. You\u2019ll learn about their capabilities and what to look for when choosing one of them for your environment.\n\n## Why do I need Snowflake cost management?\n\nSnowflake scales fast and handles serious workloads. But Snowflake, for all its strengths, wasn\u2019t built to handle cost governance on its own.\n\nIt was built for performance and flexibility, which it\u2019s good at. But these capabilities come at a cost. They make Snowflake consume more compute and storage than you intended and can afford.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t always due to deliberate overspending by your team. In most cases, it\u2019s because of how Snowflake operates under the hood.\n\nOn Snowflake, the performance of queries depends on three factors, mainly:\n\n* How your SQL is written\n* How your data is organized\n* How your warehouses are sized\n\nFor instance, if your query is poorly structured, that\u2019ll trigger unnecessary data scans. Or if a warehouse is idle, but its size is too big, that\u2019s also going to burn credits.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of governance. Configuring roles, permissions, and policies on Snowflake requires a comprehensive knowledge of the platform. Without a good grasp of the platform\u2019s internal workings, you may misconfigure these settings. Misconfigurations can lead to storage bloat or workloads running under higher-privilege warehouses, among other issues.\n\nThese were a few reasons why Snowflake cost management became necessary. In reality, there are many other reasons.\n\nAnd to manage costs the best way, you have to use a platform designed to support Snowflake cost management.\n\n## Can I just use Snowflake native cost tools?\n\nSnowflake does include built-in features to help manage spend, but these tools only go so far. So why invest in a third-party Snowflake cost-management platform?\n\nHere\u2019s what Snowflake natively provides:\n\n* **Resource Monitors:** These let you set credit limits on warehouses or your entire account. You can configure them to watch credit usage and optionally suspend warehouses when usage hits a defined limit.\n* **Budgets:** These let admins set monthly credit-spending limits and get alerts when projected spending is about to exceed. The spending limits can be set for your account or custom groups of objects.\n\nNow, let\u2019s return to our question: why not use native Snowflake tools?\n\nThe problem is that these native tools operate more like safety nets than management or optimization engines.\n\nThey don\u2019t help you understand why costs climbed. They can only inform you when spending has already reached a dangerous level.\n\nTake Resource Monitors: they can tell you a warehouse exceeded its quota, but they can\u2019t explain **why** . They don\u2019t surface inefficient queries, runaway workloads, or which teams and users are driving the spike.\n\nSnowflake also doesn\u2019t automatically map warehouse or query usage to business units, cost centers, or environments. This makes accurate cost allocation slow, manual, and often incomplete.\n\nIf you want to track Snowflake alongside the rest of your cloud ecosystem such as AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, or other SaaS data tools, native Snowflake features cannot provide unified visibility.\n\nFor organizations with multiple teams, fast-growing workloads, or high Snowflake usage, native tools cannot deliver the visibility, automation, or intelligence required to proactively manage spend.\n\nA third-party Snowflake cost management platform fills those gaps by offering:\n\n* **Full cost visibility and attribution** across teams and workloads\n* **Intelligent forecasting** that predicts spend before it spikes\n* **Automated alerts and anomaly detection** that highlight issues in real time\n\nIn short, Snowflake shows you what you spent. A third-party Snowflake management tool explains why it happened and how to reduce it.\n\n## The best Snowflake cost management and optimization tools\n\n### 1\\. Ternary\n\nTernary is a multi-cloud FinOps platform. It gives you cost visibility and control across cloud and SaaS solutions, including Snowflake.\n\nTernary\u2019s [Snowflake insights](https://ternary.app/integrations/snowflake/) shows you query counts, run times, and the type and number of credits used over a given period, broken down by account and warehouses. With these insights, you can easily spot inefficiencies that don\u2019t become obvious from a billing summary alone.\n\nFor example, if someone accidentally overprovisions a warehouse or if query performance starts dragging due to underprovisioning, Ternary will bring both to your attention.\n\nWith [Ternary\u2019s reporting engine](https://ternary.app/platform/finops-reporting-engine/) you can build custom Snowflake reports for specific teams or business units easily. You can also allocate costs to the appropriate areas of your organization to determine the total cost of ownership accurately.\n\nThe platform provides industry-leading capabilities across anomaly detection, budget management, cost allocation, and forecasting, making it a great tool for organizations that require cost management and optimization across their entire infrastructure.\n\n### 2\\. Select.dev\n\n[ [Source](https://select.dev/) ]\n\nSelect.dev is a dedicated Snowflake cost management platform. Its two main functions are Snowflake observability and optimization. Like Ternary, it also gives you a detailed visibility into credits down to individual queries, workloads, users, and teams.\n\nIn addition to providing visibility, it also continuously analyzes your account to inform you about optimization opportunities.\n\nThere\u2019s also support for automatic warehouse adjustments. For example, it can scale virtual warehouses up or down based on actual usage patterns with zero intervention from you.\n\nYou can also allocate costs to specific teams or projects, then set budget thresholds for them so they feel accountable for their spending.\n\nSelect.dev has built-in [anomaly detection](https://ternary.app/platform/anomaly-detection/) too, which informs you about spikes through channels like Slack and email.\n\n### 3\\. Datadog\n\n[ [Source](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/snowflake-monitoring-datadog/) ]\n\nDatadog isn\u2019t exclusively a Snowflake cost management tool, but like Ternary, it does provide visibility into Snowflake.\n\nThe platform shows you metrics on query performance, warehouse activity, credit consumption, storage usage, and more.\n\nYou have access to pre-built dashboards that show things like top warehouses by cost, query throughput, failed tasks, and login history. If these dashboards aren\u2019t the right fit for you, you can also build custom views for specific teams or business units.\n\nWith Datadog Cloud Cost Management, you can filter costs by service, tag, or team, then track how spending trends over time. You can also view cost-per-query to identify expensive queries and trace down the code or application that triggers them.\n\n### 4\\. Chaos Genius\n\n[ [Source](https://documentation.chaosgenius.io/snowflake/snowflake-chargeback) ]\n\nChaos Genius is a data observability tool that can also optimize costs. It analyzes usage patterns across warehouses, queries, and storage.\n\nThe platform is particularly known for its automated cloud cost optimization recommendations.\n\nFor instance, it can figure out the reason your queries are consuming so many credits and offer specific tuning suggestions.\n\nChaos Genius also offers insights about storage optimization. For example, it can identify unused tables that are still consuming storage or ones with high fail-safe costs. The platform\u2019s alerts also come through Slack or email.\n\n## How to pick the best Snowflake management tool\n\nFrom the Snowflake cost management tool vendors we discussed, which one is best for you?\n\nHere\u2019s how you can make that decision easy.\n\n### Define what you need\n\nDo you need detailed cost visibility (who\u2019s spending what), or automated optimization recommendations, or both? Most tools cover only visibility. Only some offer optimization recommendations.\n\nOnce you\u2019re clear on this, the rest becomes easier because every Snowflake environment has different gaps. Some teams are strong on tuning and only need a clean breakdown of credit consumption.\n\nOthers don\u2019t have internal bandwidth to review every warehouse or query pattern, so they rely on tools that surface inefficiencies on their behalf.\n\nThe real goal is to match the tool to your team\u2019s strengths. If your engineers already understand Snowflake deeply, visibility may be enough. If not, choose a platform that brings you closer to root-cause analysis without requiring constant manual digging.\n\n### Look for granular cost allocation\n\nMake sure the tool you\u2019re considering allows you to attribute costs by:\n\n* Project\n* Team\n* Department\n* Warehouse\n* Workload\n\nPrecise [cost allocation](https://ternary.app/platform/cloud-cost-allocation/) creates accountable teams that spend responsibly.\n\nThis level of detail is what prevents guesswork during budget reviews. Without proper allocation, most organizations end up chasing numbers at the end of the month, trying to figure out who consumed what.\n\nA strong allocation model also helps teams understand the financial impact of their daily work, which naturally leads to better resource planning. If a platform cannot break down spend in a way that mirrors your internal structure, you\u2019ll struggle to identify the real drivers behind your Snowflake bill.\n\n### Decide the level of automation you want\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two types of cost management tools:\n\n* Ones that just alert you and let you manually act on recommendations\n* And ones that make adjustments automatically\n\nYour choice depends on how reactive or proactive your team wants to be. Alert-based tools give you information but expect you to take action, which suits teams that prefer reviewing every change before it happens.\n\nAutomated tools are helpful when queries spike or warehouses drift from expected usage patterns, which, of course, saves time but requires you to trust the platform\u2019s logic.\n\nA tool that aligns with your operational style will always deliver better results.\n\n### Check for customizable dashboards and reporting\n\nIt\u2019s very common for a platform\u2019s default dashboards and reports to not fully meet your needs. So the tool you\u2019re choosing should also let you build custom dashboards and reports based on your specific needs.\n\nDifferent teams care about different metrics, so a one-size-fits-all dashboard rarely works. Finance might want rolling cost projections, while engineering needs query-level drill-downs.\n\nCustom views let each group track what matters to them without clutter. [Reporting flexibility](https://ternary.app/platform/finops-reporting-engine/) is just as important because you\u2019ll eventually need to share insights with leadership, team leads, or other stakeholders. A snowflake cost management tool that lets you shape data the way you work will always give you better long-term control.\n\n### Evaluate integration and scalability\n\nOnly choose the tool that [integrates](https://ternary.app/integrations/) well with your current Snowflake setup. Also, make sure the tool can handle growth as your Snowflake usage expands.\n\nIf a tool can\u2019t scale with your environment, you\u2019ll eventually outgrow it and end up migrating again, which creates unnecessary overhead.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nSnowflake is already a powerful platform. But at the end of the day, it still needs the right guardrails to stay cost-efficient.\n\nA Snowflake cost management platform gives you those guardrails. Ternary provides the visibility your team needs to manage Snowflake spending with confidence.\n\nSo if you want clarity on your Snowflake costs, get started with Ternary.\n\n**Explore Ternary\u2019s Snowflake functionality.**\n\n[Book a demo](https://ternary.app/demo/)\n\n## Related articles\n\n[](https://ternary.app/blog/snowflake-cost-optimization/) Blog [Snowflake cost optimization: 8 proven strategies for reducing costs](https://ternary.app/blog/snowflake-cost-optimization/)\n\n[](https://ternary.app/blog/manage-your-snowflake-costs/) Blog [Harness Snowflake\u2019s power\u2014without the pain](https://ternary.app/blog/manage-your-snowflake-costs/)\n\n[](https://ternary.app/blog/everest-group-leader-2025/) Blog [Everest Group names Ternary a 2025 FinOps Leader](https://ternary.app/blog/everest-group-leader-2025/)\n\n[](https://ternary.app/)\n\nAvailable as a SaaS platform and a self-hosted solution, Ternary manages more than $7.5B in multi-cloud spend across leading enterprises and managed service providers.\n\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ternaryinc/) [](https://twitter.com/ternaryinc) [](https://www.youtube.com/@ternaryinc)\n\n* [Privacy policy](https://ternary.app/privacy-policy/)\n* [LLM info](https://ternary.app/llm-info/)"

Chaos Genius has been [acquired by Flexera](https://www.flexera.com/more/ProsperOps-Chaos-Genius) .\n\nBuilding and deploying [data applications](https://www.snowflake.com/guides/applications/) often comes with unnecessary complexity. Snowflake has significantly reduced this by introducing **Snowflake Native Apps** . Snowflake Native Apps allow you to build, run and monetize data apps directly within the Snowflake ecosystem. No external integrations. No infrastructure headaches. Snowflake previously supported [Connected Apps](https://www.snowflake.com/guides/connected-apps) , which operated outside Snowflake, connected via [APIs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/api-reference) and required manual data movement. Native Apps, by contrast, run entirely within Snowflake, leveraging its secure and scalable infrastructure . They\u2019re built using the _Snowflake Native App Framework_ , allowing you to develop secure, scalable and integrated Snowflake apps that leverage Snowflake\u2019s environment without leaving the Snowflake platform.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the features, benefits and inner workings of Snowflake Native Apps and walk you through the step-by-step process of creating a Snowflake Native App and publishing and monetizing your Native Apps through the Snowflake Marketplace.\n\n## What Are Snowflake Native Applications?\n\n**Snowflake Native Apps** are applications built using the Snowflake Native App Framework, which allows developers to create, test and deploy applications directly within Snowflake\u2019s Data Cloud. These Native Apps leverage Snowflake\u2019s core features like stored procedures , user-defined functions (Snowflake UDFs) and the [Snowpark API](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index) , all while keeping the data secure by running the code on your data stored in Snowflake. Native apps are available on the Snowflake Marketplace . You can discover and install them quickly, just like downloading an app on your smartphone.\n\n**TL;DR:  \n** **What They Are** \u2014 Snowflake Native Apps run entirely within Snowflake, eliminating the need to move data out for processing.  \n**How They Work** \u2014 Snowflake Native Apps operate in your Snowflake account, using your existing data without external connections. Developers create and distribute them via the Snowflake Marketplace.  \n**Why Use Them** :\n\n* **Fast** \u2014 Snowflake Native Apps process data directly in Snowflake, reducing latency.\n* **Secure** \u2014 Snowflake Native Apps don\u2019t access or store data outside your account, relying on Snowflake\u2019s encryption and access controls.\n* **Scalable** \u2014 Snowflake Native Apps can grow alongside your Snowflake resources, handling larger datasets or more users.\n\nSnowflake Native Apps (Source: [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/applications/native-apps/) )\n\n### Key Technical Characteristics of Snowflake Native Apps\n\n#### 1) **Native Integration with Snowflake Services**\n\nSnowflake Native Apps work directly with Snowflake\u2019s core services. They use stored procedures , user-defined functions (Snowflake UDFs UDFs) and the Snowpark API, making them efficient and seamless.\n\n#### 2) **Simplified Development and Testing**\n\nYou can build Snowflake Native Applications using the Snowflake Native App Framework. Snowflake Native App Framework streamlines development and testing. You can create, test and deploy Snowflake apps within Snowflake, reducing development time.\n\n#### 3) **Monetization via Snowflake Marketplace**\n\nProviders can list and sell Snowflake apps in the Snowflake Marketplace . Consumers install these apps directly into their Snowflake accounts, simplifying deployment and making app monetization straightforward.\n\n#### 4) **Security and Governance**\n\nSnowflake Native Applications don\u2019t transfer data outside the platform. Providers can package their logic securely, protecting intellectual property. Users maintain control of access permissions, with data security managed by Snowflake\u2019s encryption and governance features .\n\n#### 5) **Data Sharing**\n\nSnowflake Native Apps leverage [Snowflake\u2019s secure data sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro) . Apps can access shared datasets without creating duplicates or requiring data to leave the user\u2019s Snowflake account.\n\n#### 6) **Advanced Feature Support**\n\nSnowflake Native Applications use Snowflake features like:\n\n* User-Defined Functions (Snowflake UDFs)\n* Stored Procedures\n* [Snowpark](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index)\n\n#### 7) **Versioning and Patching**\n\nSnowflake Native App Framework supports versioning and patching, allowing you to manage updates easily. This keeps your apps up to date.\n\n#### 8) **Streamlit Integration**\n\nYou can integrate your apps with Streamlit , which allows you to create interactive dashboards within Snowflake. While the integration is still evolving, it supports embedding visualizations in your apps for end-user analytics.\n\n#### 9) **Encapsulation in Application Packages**\n\nSnowflake Native Apps are bundled into packages containing all necessary components (e.g., data content, application logic, metadata and setup scripts). This makes deployment simple and reduces compatibility issues.\n\n#### 10) **Source Control and Tool Integration**\n\nYou can integrate with external tools like [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) , [CI/CD pipelines](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-cicd-pipeline) and source control systems. This flexibility helps teams adopt DevOps practices when developing Snowflake Native Applications.\n\n#### 11) **AI and ML Workflows**\n\nSnowflake Native Applications support machine learning and AI tasks through Snowpark. You can integrate external ML libraries, process training data and deploy models directly within Snowflake.\n\n#### 12) **Cross-Cloud Deployment (AWS + Azure + with limitations on GCP)**\n\nSnowflake Native Applications are compatible with multiple clouds ( [AWS](https://www.snowflake.com/en/why-snowflake/partners/all-partners/aws/) , [Azure](https://www.snowflake.com/en/why-snowflake/partners/all-partners/microsoft/) and limit on [GCP](https://www.snowflake.com/technology-partners/google-cloud-platform/) ). This feature enables users to run apps across different infrastructures, though GCP support has limitations.\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Snowflake Native Apps \u2014 For Providers?\n\nSnowflake Native Apps offer significant advantages for providers looking to build, distribute and monetize their applications within the Snowflake ecosystem. Here are some of the benefits:\n\n### \u27a5 Simplified Development\n\nProviders can use Snowflake\u2019s tools to build apps that leverage Snowflake\u2019s high availability and scalability. This completely eliminates the need for separate infrastructure, reducing development overhead and speeding up time to market\u200b.\n\nSnowflake Native Apps run within customers\u2019 Snowflake accounts, meaning data stays within their environment, which minimizes the complexity of data integration and security management\u200b.\n\n### \u27a5 **On-Platform Monetization Opportunities**\n\nProviders can easily sell and monetize their Snowflake apps directly within the Snowflake ecosystem via Snowflake Marketplace , bypassing the need for third-party systems.\n\n### \u27a5 **Easy Management**\n\nSince apps are hosted within Snowflake\u2019s infrastructure, you don\u2019t need to manage separate resources. Snowflake offers always-on availability, global reach, built-in governance and secure operations.\n\n### \u27a5 **Data Protection**\n\nSnowflake Native Apps interact directly with the customer\u2019s Snowflake account. This approach keeps customer data within their environment, reducing security risks and compliance burdens. You avoid the complexity of managing sensitive data, as Snowflake\u2019s internal security and governance capability can handle it for you.\n\n### \u27a5 **Zero Infrastructure Management and Lower Operational Costs**\n\nTraditional Snowflake apps often require providers to pay for their own compute and storage. With Snowflake Native Applications, you leverage the customer\u2019s compute resources, reducing your operating costs and improving profit margins.\n\n### \u27a5 **Access to New Customers**\n\nSnowflake Marketplace gives you exposure to a global Snowflake customer base. Here, customers can find, test and purchase your apps. This built-in distribution network simplifies how you reach and onboard users while enabling seamless deployment directly into customer environments.\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Snowflake Native Apps \u2014 For Consumers?\n\nSnowflake Native Apps offer significant advantages for end-users, enhancing their ability to integrate, utilize and manage data applications seamlessly within the Snowflake ecosystem. Here are some of the key benefits of Native Snowflake apps for consumers:\n\n### \u27a5 **Quick and Easy Access**\n\nConsumers can easily search for Snowflake Native Applications on the Snowflake Marketplace or in private listings and directly install and use them with a single click.\n\n### \u27a5 **Secure Data Use**\n\nSince Snowflake Native Applications run directly in the consumer\u2019s Snowflake account, data does not need to leave the platform. This eliminates the risks associated with data transfers and ensures compliance with Snowflake\u2019s robust governance and security controls.\n\n### \u27a5 **Enhanced Performance**\n\nSnowflake Native apps utilize the consumer\u2019s Snowflake compute resources, which ensures optimal performance tailored to the existing workload. Consumers benefit from Snowflake\u2019s underlying scalability and processing power, resulting in faster query execution and application responsiveness\u200b.\n\n### \u27a5 **Streamlined Trial and Deployment**\n\nConsumers can easily test applications via trial periods. Transitioning from trial to full versions is simple and data generated during the trial is retained for future use, making the adoption process seamless and risk-free.\n\n### \u27a5 **Simplified Application Management**\n\nConsumers can manage access privileges, event logging and app-related tasks directly within their Snowflake account.\n\n## How Do Snowflake Native Applications Work?\n\nSnowflake Native Applications leverage the _Snowflake Native App Framework_ to build and deploy data-driven applications directly within the Snowflake ecosystem. These Snowflake apps harness Snowflake\u2019s core features\u2014secure data sharing, analytics, compute and governance\u2014enabling seamless integration and monetization, without requiring data to move outside the platform. The framework supports applications ranging from analytical tools to fully containerized services.\n\nSnowflake Native App Framework allows:\n\n* Providers to share data, business logic and application interfaces (e.g., Streamlit apps, stored procedures) using [Snowpark API](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index) , [Python](https://www.python.org/) , [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) .\n* Applications to be listed as free or paid offerings on the Snowflake Marketplace or shared privately with select accounts.\n* Developers to benefit from streamlined testing environments, version control via external repositories and detailed logging for troubleshooting.\n* Built-in support for structured and unstructured event logging to streamline troubleshooting and performance tracking.\n* Integration with Streamlit to build interactive, user-friendly visual interfaces.\n\nOn top of that, the Snowflake Native Framework also provides an enhanced developer experience, including:\n\n* A unified testing environment for app lifecycle management.\n* Integration with version control systems for seamless code and resource management.\n* Incremental app updates with versioning and patch support.\n\nSnowflake Native Apps extend the functionality of features like Secure Data Sharing and Collaboration, ensuring providers can offer scalable, governed applications to other Snowflake users.\n\n### Architecture of the Snowflake Native App Framework\n\nThe architecture of the Snowflake Native App Framework operates on a provider-consumer model:\n\n* **Provider** \u2014 Creates and shares data and application logic using the framework.\n* **Consumer** \u2014 Installs and interacts with applications shared by providers.\n\nSnowflake Native Applications are packaged as **Application Packages** , which contains the necessary logic, metadata and configuration to deploy a Snowflake Native App. This includes:\n\n* **Manifest file** : Configuration details, including setup script locations and versioning.\n* **Setup script** : Contains SQL commands for installation and updates.\n\nThe provider publishes the Snowflake Native app via:\n\n* **Marketplace Listings** \u2014 Accessible to all Snowflake users for broad distribution.\n* **Private Listings** \u2014 Targeted sharing with specific accounts across regions.\n\nUpon installation, Snowflake creates a corresponding database object for the app, which runs the setup script to establish necessary resources in the consumer\u2019s account. Additional configurations like logging or privilege grants can be applied post-installation.\n\nSnowflake Native App Architecture\n\n### How do Snowflake Native Applications work with Snowpark Container Services?\n\nFor advanced use cases, Snowflake Native Applications can utilize [**Snowpark Container Services**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) , which enable Snowflake apps to manage containerized workloads within Snowflake. This approach supports high-performance applications, such as machine learning and AI-driven analytics, without externalizing data.\n\nComponents unique to containerized Snowflake apps:\n\n* **Services specification file** \u2014 Applications reference container images stored in the provider\u2019s repository.\n* **Compute pool** \u2014 A collection of virtual machine nodes where containerized workloads execute.\n\nSnowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Architecture\n\nFeatures of Snowpark Container Services include:\n\n* Support for AI/ML workloads with low latency.\n* Persistent data and model storage close to compute resources for efficiency.\n* Seamless deployment across GPU/CPU configurations.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Snowflake Native App\n\nNow that we have covered the features, benefits and inner workings/architecture of Snowflake Native Applications, let\u2019s dive into a step-by-step guide on how you can create a simple Snowflake Native App on Snowflake.\n\nBefore you start building a Snowflake Native App, make sure you meet these requirements:\n\n## Prerequisite:\n\n* **Snowflake CLI** : Install the Snowflake CLI on your machine.\n* [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : If you haven\u2019t already installed VSCode, download it from here.\n* **ACCOUNTADMIN Role** : Use the ACCOUNTADMIN role for all steps in this tutorial.\n* **Second Snowflake Account** : If installing your app from a private listing, you need access to a second Snowflake account.\n* **Set a Current Warehouse** : Use the USE WAREHOUSE command to specify the active warehouse.\n* **SQL Command Session** : Run all SQL commands within the same session. The session context must remain consistent as the steps build on one another.\n\nLet\u2019s kick off by covering the main pieces you\u2019ll be working with.\n\n**Application Package**\n\nThink of this as a container for your entire application. It holds:\n\n* Shared data\n* Application logic\n* Deployment artifacts\n\n**Setup Script**\n\nThe blueprint of your application\u2019s initialization. This script:\n\n* Creates schemas\n* Sets up application roles\n* Defines initial objects and permissions\n\n**Manifest File**\n\nYour app\u2019s configuration metadata. It tells Snowflake:\n\n* Which files to include\n* How to structure the deployment\n* Runtime behaviors\n\n**Project Definition File**\n\nDefines deployment specifics:\n\n* Application package name\n* Stages\n* Artifacts to include\n\n### **Step 1** \u2014Configuring the Environment\n\n```\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS my_app_db;\nUSE DATABASE my_app_db;\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS my_app_schema;\n```\n\nThis sets up a dedicated space for your app\u2019s data and logic.\n\nNow make sure you have an active warehouse set for executing your SQL commands. You can create a new warehouse or use an existing one:\n\n```\nCREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS <warehouse> WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL';\nUSE WAREHOUSE <warehouse>;\n```\n\n### **Step 2** \u2014Setting Up Snowflake CLI\n\nTo get started, you need to install and configure Snowflake CLI. It allows users to execute SQL queries and carry out a wide range of DDL and DML operations.\n\nTo download Snowflake CLI, first download from the [SnowSQL download page](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/downloads/snowsql/) and then open a new terminal window. Execute the following code to test your connection:\n\n```\nsnow connection add\n```\n\nOnce you have done that, enter all the credentials when prompted.\n\nAdding Snowflake CLI credentials\n\nThat\u2019s it!\n\n> For detailed instructions on installing Snowflake CLI, [refer to the official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/installation/installation) .\n> \n> \n\n### **Step 3** \u2014Initializing a New Project\n\nNow that your environment is set up, you will initialize a new project folder for your app using the Snowflake CLI. Open your terminal and execute:\n\n```\nsnow init --template app_basic snowflake_native_app_demo\n```\n\nInitializing Snowflake Native App project\n\nThis command creates a directory named **snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_demo** , which contains a basic structure for your Snowflake Native App project.\n\nFolder structure of Demo Snowflake Native App\n\nHere\u2019s what is inside the app directory:\n\nFolder structure of Demo Snowflake Native App\n\n**OR**\n\nYou can clone the starter project which is provided by Snowflake by running the following command:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-native-apps.git\n```\n\nCloning Starter Snowflake Native App project\n\n### **Step 4** \u2014Creating Application Files\n\nNavigate to the **snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_demo** directory and create several essential files:\n\n**\u27a5 Configuring Setup Script**\n\nThis SQL script runs automatically when a consumer installs your app. Modify **app/setup\\_script.sql** with the following content (add comment for now, we will update the script later on):\n\n```\n-- Snowflake Native App Setup script\n```\n\n**\u27a5 Configuring Manifest File**\n\nThis YAML file contains configuration information about your app. Create/Update **app/manifest.yml** with this:\n\n**\u27a5 Configuring Project Definition File**\n\nThis YAML file defines objects that can be deployed to Snowflake. Create/Update **snowflake.yml** in the root of your project with this:\n\n```\ndefinition_version: 2\nentities:\n\t\tsnowflake_native_app_demo_package:\n\t\t\ttype: application package\n\t\t\t stage: stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\n\t\t\t manifest: app/manifest.yml\n\t\t\t identifier: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\tartifacts:\n\t\t\t\t - src: app/*\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdest: ./\n\t demo_snowflake_native_app:\n\t\t\t type: application\n\t\t\tfrom:\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\t debug: false\n```\n\nThis file is central to setting up a Snowflake Native App. It specifies key details about the app\u2019s configuration and how resources are managed within Snowflake.\n\nTo create an application package, you need the [CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-application-package) privilege. If your role doesn\u2019t have this, you can grant it with the Snowflake CLI:\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"GRANT CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE accountadmin\" -c <connection_name>\n```\n\nGranting Create Application Package to account admin\n\n> Replace **connection\\_name** with the connection name specified in your **config.toml** file.\n> \n> \n\n**snowflake.yml** file defines objects and configuration details. Here\u2019s what it includes:\n\n**a) Application Package**\n\nServes as the container for app-related objects. Example: snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_demo\\_package\n\n**b) Application Object**\n\nCreated from the application package. Example: **demo\\_snowflake\\_native\\_app**\n\n**c) Named Stage**\n\nHolds application files. Example: **stage\\_content.hello\\_snowflake\\_stage** . The stage name is schema-qualified and created inside the application package.\n\nIt stores files for setup scripts or runtime use.\n\n**Artifacts Section**\n\nSpecifies file rules for deployment. Example: Files in app/ are uploaded to the root of the stage.\n\nExample mappings:\n\n```\ntutorial/app/manifest.yml \u2192 @snowflake_native_app_demo_package.stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\ntutorial/app/README.md \u2192 @snowflake_native_app_demo_package.stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\ntutorial/app/setup_script.sql \u2192 @snowflake_native_app_demo_package.stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\n```\n\n> Use <% \u2026 %> syntax for dynamic referencing. Example: <% ctx.entities.pkg.identifier %> accesses the package identifier.\n> \n> \n\n**Debug Mode**\n\nThe debug field in **snowflake.yml** is set to **false** for production. Debug mode is typically enabled by default during development.\n\n**\u27a5 Configuring README File**\n\nThis file provides a description of your application. Create **app/README.md** with a brief description:\n\n```\nThis is a demo Snowflake Native App.\n```\n\n### **Step 5** \u2014Writing the Snowflake Native Application Logic\n\nNow let\u2019s get to the essence of Snowflake Native App development\u2014adding application logic and installing your first app. This involves creating stored procedures, setting up application roles and configuring privileges for seamless execution. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n**\u27a5 Add a Stored Procedure to the Setup Script**\n\nThe setup script is central to your app\u2019s functionality. By extending it, you can define key components like roles and stored procedures.\n\nFirst let\u2019s define an Application Role. To do so, add the following to your **setup\\_script.sql** file:\n\n```\nCREATE APPLICATION ROLE IF NOT EXISTS snowflake_native_app_public;\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS native_app_core;\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA native_app_core TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nAs you can see, this creates an application-specific role ( _snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_public_ ) and a schema (native\\_app\\_core) for the app. And the role is restricted to the app\u2019s context and manages access to app-specific objects.\n\nNext, add a stored procedure that your app can call:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE native_app_core.HELLO()\n\tRETURNS STRING\n\tLANGUAGE SQL\n\tEXECUTE AS OWNER\n\tAS\nBEGIN\n\t RETURN 'Demo Snowflake Native App!';\nEND;\n```\n\nThis stored procedure outputs a simple greeting\u2014useful as a test or base for more complex logic.\n\nFinally, grant the application role permission to use the procedure:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON PROCEDURE native_app_core.hello() TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nNow this role can access and execute the stored procedure.\n\nHere is how your **setup\\_script.sql** file should look like:\n\nWriting the Snowflake Native Application Logic\n\nOnce your setup script includes the necessary logic, install the app in stage dev mode using the Snowflake CLI. Dev mode lets you test app behavior before deploying it to production.\n\nTo test it, run the following Snowflake CLI command:\n\n```\nsnow app run -c connection_name\n```\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\nAs you can see, if the command runs successfully, it outputs a URL where you can see your app in Snowsight.\n\nChecking a Deployed Snowflake Native App in Snowsight\n\nTo run the stored procedure that you added to **setup\\_script.sql** in a previous section, run the following Snowflake CLI command:\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"call demo_snowflake_native_app.native_app_core.hello()\" -c connection_name\n```\n\nYou should see the following result/output:\n\nRunning deployed Stored procedure via Snowflake CLI\n\n### **Step 6** \u2014Adding Data Content to Your Snowflake Native App\n\nIn this step, you\u2019ll enhance your Snowflake Native App by incorporating shared data content. This involves creating and sharing a table within your app package and granting access to app users. Additionally, you\u2019ll create a view for secure data access by consumers.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s create a table to share with the app. To do so, you can add a table to your app package by writing a SQL script and specifying its execution in the project definition file.\n\nSo let\u2019s create and populate the table. To do that, you need to create a folder **scripts** and inside that folder, create a file called **shared\\_content.sql** . Then, add the following code:\n\n```\nUSE APPLICATION PACKAGE <% ctx.entities.snowflake_native_app_demo_package.identifier %>;\n\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS shared_data;\nUSE SCHEMA shared_data;\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wealthy_individuals (\n\t\tid INT,\n\t\t name VARCHAR,\n\t\tstatus VARCHAR\n);\n\nTRUNCATE TABLE wealthy_individuals;\n\nINSERT INTO wealthy_individuals VALUES\n\t\t (1, 'Elon', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(2, 'Bernard', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(3, 'Jeff', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t (4, 'Warren', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(5, 'Larry', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(6, 'Sergey', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t (7, 'Gautam', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(8, 'Carlos', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t (9, 'Mukesh', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(10, 'Bill', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t(11, 'Mark', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t(12, 'Larry', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t (13, 'Michael', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t(14, 'Aman', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t(15, 'Warren', 'Billionaire');\n```\n\nNow, grant access to the table and schema using:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA shared_data TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE <% ctx.entities.snowflake_native_app_demo_package.identifier %>;\nGRANT SELECT ON TABLE wealthy_individuals TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE <% ctx.entities.snowflake_native_app_demo_package.identifier %>;\n```\n\nThe placeholder `<% ctx.entities.snowflake_native_app_demo_package.identifier %>` dynamically resolves to your application package identifier during deployment.\n\n**Add the Script to the Project Definition File**\n\nUpdate the **snowflake.yml** file to include the new script in post-deployment hooks:\n\n```\ndefinition_version: 2\nentities:\n\t snowflake_native_app_demo_package:\n\t\t\t type: application package\n\t\t\tstage: stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\n\t\t\tmanifest: app/manifest.yml\n\t\t\tidentifier: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\t artifacts:\n\t\t\t\t\t- src: app/*\n\t\t\t\t\t dest: ./\n\t\t\t meta:\n\t\t\t\t post_deploy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t - sql_script: scripts/shared_content.sql\n\t\tdemo_snowflake_native_app:\n\t\t\ttype: application\n\t\t\t from:\n\t\t\t\t target: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\tdebug: false\n```\n\nNext, modify the **setup\\_script.sql** file to create a view that app consumers can use to query the data.\n\n**Create a Versioned Schema:**\n\n```\nCREATE OR ALTER VERSIONED SCHEMA code_schema;\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA code_schema TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\n**Create the View:**\n\n```\nCREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS code_schema.accounts_view\n\t AS SELECT roll_number, NAME, VALUE\n\t FROM shared_data.wealthy_individuals;\nGRANT SELECT ON VIEW code_schema.accounts_view TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nAfter adding the table and view, test the updated app to make sure everything works as expected. Let\u2019s deploy the updates:\n\n```\nsnow app run -c connection_name\n```\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\nThis uploads the edited files to the stage, runs **scripts/shared\\_content.sql** and deploys the app.\n\nNow, finally to verify the data access, fire the command below:\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"SELECT * FROM demo_snowflake_native_app.code_schema.accounts_view\" -c connection_name\n```\n\nVerifying Snowflake data access\n\nThe output should list the sample data from the accounts table.\n\n### **Step 7** \u2014Adding Python Code to Your Snowflake Native App\n\nLet\u2019s enhance our Snowflake Native App by incorporating Python-based logic using User-Defined Functions (Snowflake UDFs). We\u2019ll add both an inline Python UDF and one that references an external Python module.\n\nInline Python UDFs enable you to embed Python logic directly within your setup script. To do so, update your setup script to include the following code:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION code_schema.squareroot(i INT)\nRETURNS INT\nLANGUAGE PYTHON\nRUNTIME_VERSION = '3.11'\nHANDLER = 'squareroot_py'\nAS\n$$\ndef squareroot_py(i):\n\t return i * i\n$$;\n\nGRANT USAGE ON FUNCTION code_schema.squareroot(INT) TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nAs you can see, this:\n\n* Creates a Python UDF named squareroot in the code\\_schema schema.\n* Uses Python 3.11 runtime.\n* Grants the necessary usage privilege to the snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_public role.\n\nNow let\u2019s reference a Python file for modular and reusable logic. First, let\u2019s add this code to your setup script:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION code_schema.cuberoot(i INT)\nRETURNS FLOAT\nLANGUAGE PYTHON\nRUNTIME_VERSION = 3.11\nIMPORTS = ('/python/cube_python.py')\nHANDLER = 'cube_python.cuberoot';\n\nGRANT USAGE ON FUNCTION code_schema.cuberoot(INT) TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nNow let\u2019s add the external Python file. To do this, in the project folder, create a subdirectory: **python/** . Inside this folder, create a file named **cube\\_python.py** with the following content:\n\n```\ndef cuberoot(i):\n\t return i * i * i\n```\n\nUpdate the project definition file to include the Python file:\n\n```\nartifacts:\n\t- src: python/cube_python.py\n```\n\nAfter adding the Python UDFs, deploy and validate their functionality.\n\n**Deploy the Updates:**\n\n```\nsnow app run -c connection_name\n```\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\nThis uploads the updated files to the stage and deploys the app.\n\n**Test the Inline Python UDF:**\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"SELECT demo_snowflake_native_app.code_schema.squareroot(2)\" -c connection_name\n```\n\nOutput:\n\nTesting the Inline Python UDF \u2013 Snowflake Native App\n\n**Test the External Python UDF:**\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"SELECT demo_snowflake_native_app.code_schema.cuberoot(2)\" -c connection_name\n```\n\nOutput:\n\nTesting the External Python UDF \u2013 Snowflake Native App\n\n### **Step 8** \u2014Adding a Streamlit App to Your Snowflake Native App\n\nNow, let\u2019s integrate a Streamlit-based user interface into your Snowflake Native App. Streamlit is an open-source framework designed for building interactive data applications, offering features for data visualization and user interaction.\n\nHead over to your project folder and create a subdirectory named **streamlit/** . Inside the streamlit folder, create a file named **streamlit\\_app.py** . Then, add the following Python code to **streamlit\\_app.py** :\n\n```\n# Import python packages\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom snowflake.snowpark import Session\n\nst.title(\"Demo Snowflake Native Application\")\nst.write(\n\t\t\"\"\"Demo of Snowflake Native Application\"\"\")\n\n# Get the current credentials\nsession = Session.builder.getOrCreate()\n\n# Create an example data frame\ndata_frame = session.sql(\"SELECT * FROM code_schema.accounts_view\")\n\n# Execute the query and convert it into a Pandas data frame\nqueried_data = data_frame.to_pandas()\n\n# Display the Pandas data frame as a Streamlit data frame.\nst.dataframe(queried_data, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\nNext, add the following to the artifacts section of the project definition file:\n\n```\nartifacts:\n\t - src: streamlit/streamlit_app.py\n```\n\nThis is how your **snowflake.yml** should look:\n\n```\ndefinition_version: 2\nentities:\n\t\tsnowflake_native_app_demo_package:\n\t\t\ttype: application package\n\t\t\t stage: stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\n\t\t\t manifest: app/manifest.yml\n\t\t\t identifier: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\tartifacts:\n\t\t\t\t - src: app/*\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdest: ./\n\t\t\t\t - src: python/cube_python.py\n\t\t\t\t\t- src: streamlit/streamlit_app.py\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tmeta:\n\t\t\t\t\tpost_deploy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- sql_script: scripts/shared_content.sql\n\t demo_snowflake_native_app:\n\t\t\t type: application\n\t\t\tfrom:\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\t debug: false\n```\n\nThen, create the Streamlit object. To do that, add the following to the end of the **setup\\_script.sql** file:\n\n```\nCREATE STREAMLIT IF NOT EXISTS code_schema.snowflake_streamlit_native_app\n\tFROM '/streamlit'\n\t MAIN_FILE = '/streamlit_app.py'\n;\n```\n\nAdd the following statement to the same script to allow the application role to access the Streamlit object:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON STREAMLIT code_schema.hello_snowflake_streamlit TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nDeploy the updates by running the following command to update the app:\n\n```\nsnow app run -c connection_name\n```\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\nAfter deployment, a URL will be printed in the console. Navigate to this URL to interact with the app. Click the **snowflake\\_streamlit\\_native\\_app** tab to view the Streamlit interface.\n\nChecking a Deployed Streamlit App in Snowsight\n\n### **Step 9** \u2014Versioning Your Snowflake Native App\n\nLets formalize your Snowflake Native App by creating a version. While previous steps utilized \u201cstage development\u201d mode for rapid iteration, adding a version is essential for listing the application package and sharing it with other Snowflake users.\n\nRun the following command to create version V1 for the **snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_demo\\_package** application package:\n\n```\nsnow app version create v1 -c connection_name\n```\n\nVersioning Snowflake Native App\n\nHere is how you would check the version of the app to see whether it was added successfully or not. To do so, run the following command:\n\n```\nsnow app version list -c connection_name\n```\n\nVersioning Snowflake Native App\n\n### **Step 10** \u2014Installing and Testing the Versioned App\n\nTo install and test the versioned app, run the following command to install the app based on the created version:\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\n### **Step 11** \u2014Viewing Snowflake Native App in Snowsight\n\nAfter finalizing your Snowflake Native App, you can use Snowsight, Snowflake\u2019s web interface, to explore your app visually, instead of relying solely on SQL commands.\n\nTo start, sign in to Snowsight using your Snowflake credentials. Once logged in, switch to the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role to ensure you have the necessary permissions. You can do this by selecting your username from the navigation menu, opening the account menu and switching from the current active role (e.g., PUBLIC) to **ACCOUNTADMIN** . Next, navigate to the **Data Products** section and select **Apps** from the menu.\n\nNavigating to Data Products > Apps section\n\nLocate your application, **DEMO\\_SNOWFLAKE\\_NATIVE\\_APP** , in the list.\n\nChecking a Deployed Snowflake Native App in Snowsight\n\nClicking on it opens the **Read Me** tab, which displays the content of the **README.md** file you created earlier in this tutorial.\n\nTo view the Streamlit interface, find and select **SNOWFLAKE\\_STREAMLIT\\_NATIVE\\_APP** .\n\nChecking a Deployed Streamlit App in Snowsight\n\n## Monetization and Distribution of Snowflake Native App\n\nNow that we have covered the detailed steps of how you can create and build Snowflake Native Applications from scratch, let\u2019s go through the process of how you can monetize your Snowflake Native Applications via Snowflake Marketplace. But before that, let\u2019s actually understand what Snowflake Marketplace is.\n\nThe Snowflake Marketplace is a platform where users can discover, evaluate and purchase a variety of products, including third-party data, data services, Snowflake Native Apps and AI products. It serves as a public data exchange integrated within the Snowflake Data Cloud, facilitating seamless and secure transactions between data providers and consumers.\n\nThe Snowflake marketplace offers various types of data products, such as:\n\n* Raw datasets\n* Refined and enriched data\n* Historical datasets for forecasting and machine learning\n* Real-time data streams (like weather or traffic updates)\n* Specialized identity or audience data for analytics\n* Snowflake Native Applications\n* Pre-built data pipelines and transformations\n\nSnowflake Marketplace leverages Snowflake\u2019s architecture to facilitate the secure sharing of data and applications. Transactions are managed natively, eliminating the need for third-party billing systems. Vendors can offer their products through various pricing models, such as pay-as-you-go, one-time payment, usage-based payment, or subscription-based plans, while benefiting from Snowflake\u2019s built-in analytics to track customer engagement.\n\nLet\u2019s jump right into the juicy part of the article: a step-by-step guide to monetizing Snowflake Native Applications via Snowflake Marketplace.\n\n### Step-By-Step Monetization Process of a Snowflake Native App via Snowflake Marketplace\n\n#### **Step 1** \u2014Prepare Your Snowflake Native Application Package\n\nBefore monetization, make sure your Snowflake Native App meets Snowflake\u2019s submission requirements:\n\n* The app must be fully functional upon installation, with all necessary resources and configurations included.\n* It must not depend on external systems for core functionality.\n* Should Leverage Snowflake-stored or shared data for operations.\n* Include the following files:\n  \n    + **manifest.yml** (outlines app permissions and dependencies).\n    + **readme.md** (describes app functionality, post-installation setup steps and sample usage SQL).\n    + Setup scripts and external components like Streamlit files or UDF code\n\n#### **Step 2** \u2014Define the Default Release Directive\n\nNow, set the release directive to specify the app version and patch available for distribution:\n\nList available versions and patches:\n\n```\nsnow app version list -c connection_name\n```\n\nThen, set the default release directive:\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE <your_app_package> SET DEFAULT RELEASE DIRECTIVE VERSION = v1 PATCH = 0\"\n```\n\nVersioning Snowflake Native App\n\nAs you can see, this command sets version **v1** and patch **0** as the default for your app, ensuring it is ready for deployment\u200b.\n\n#### **Step 3** \u2014Create and Configure a Private Listing on the Snowflake Marketplace\n\nTo share your app via the Snowflake Marketplace, start by signing in to Snowsight and navigating to **Data Products > Provider Studio** .\n\nNavigating to Provider Studio in Snowflake\n\nClick **\\+ Listing** to create a new listing and proceed with configuration. Enter a name for the listing and specify the discovery permissions, choosing whether the listing will be public or restricted to specific consumers (e.g., select \u201c **Only specified consumers** \u201d for private sharing and select \u201c **Anyone on the Marketplace** \u201d for public listing).\n\nCreating a private listing for only specified consumers \u2013 Snowflake Native App\n\nAttach the application package you prepared earlier as the core data content for the listing. Provide a detailed description outlining your app\u2019s features and usage scenarios. If creating a private listing, add the account identifiers of intended consumers in the \u201c **Add** **Consumer accounts** \u201d section. Finally, publish your listing for approval.\n\nCreating a private listing for only specified consumers \u2013 Snowflake Native App\n\n#### **Step 4** \u2014Create and Configure a Public Paid Listing on the Snowflake Marketplace\n\nNow, to create a public listing, you need to first contact your Snowflake business development partner to approve your paid listing. If you don\u2019t have a business development partner, you\u2019ll need to [submit a case with Marketplace Operations](https://snowflakecommunity.force.com/s/provider-onboarding-case) . Before proceeding, verify that your [role has the required privileges to create a listing](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-becoming) .\n\nOnce everything is in place, you need to log in to Snowsight and go to Data Products > Provider Studio from the menu. Select **\\+ Listing** to open the Create Listing window. Here, name your listing and set its visibility. To make the listing publicly discoverable, choose \u201c **Anyone on the Marketplace** \u201d under the discovery settings.\n\nCreating a paid private listing for only specified consumers \u2013 Snowflake Marketplace\n\nNext, you need to decide how consumers will access your data product: choose \u201c **Free** \u201d for no-cost access, \u201c **Personalized/Limited Trial** \u201d to offer a trial version with full access upon request, or \u201c **Paid** \u201d if you plan to charge consumers directly.\n\nAfter setting the access type, click **Next** to generate a draft listing. Lastly, refine and configure the draft by including all necessary details to ready it for publication on the Snowflake Marketplace.\n\n#### **Step 5** \u2014Submit Listing for Approval\n\nAll listings on the Snowflake Marketplace must undergo a review and approval process before publication. If a listing is rejected, review the provided feedback, make the necessary updates and resubmit it for approval.\n\nBefore publishing make sure that your listing configuration is complete, you have the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role or **OWNERSHIP** privilege for the associated data product and all sample SQL queries in the listing are validated successfully. To submit your listing, sign in to Snowsight, navigate to **Data Products \u27a4 Provider Studio** , go to the Listings tab, select your draft listing and click **Submit for Approval** .\n\nSubmitting listing for final approval from Snowflake\n\n#### **Step 6** \u2014Final Approval and Publishing\n\nOnce submitted, Snowflake will review your listing and provide an **Approved** or **Denied** status. If denied, review the feedback, make the necessary updates and resubmit the listing. After receiving approval, return to the **Listings** tab, select your approved listing and click **Publish** . Upon publication, the listing will be visible to consumers in all current and future Snowflake Marketplace regions. Regional availability can be managed through cross-cloud auto-fulfillment settings and you can create referral links for direct access to your listing.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Snowflake Native Apps](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/applications/native-apps/)\n* [What Are Native Apps?](https://www.snowflake.com/guides/what-are-native-apps/)\n* [About the Snowflake Native App Framework](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/native-apps-about)\n* [Snowflake Native App Framework on AWS and Azure](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/native-app-framework-available-aws-azure/)\n* [Introducing the Snowflake Native App Framework](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/introducing-snowflake-native-application-framework/)\n* [Getting Started with Snowflake Native Apps](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_native_apps/)\n* [Snowflake Native Apps Example](https://github.com/snowflakedb/native-apps-examples)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap!
