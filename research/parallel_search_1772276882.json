Many of these providers make their products available on Snowflake Marketplace for Snowflake customers to purchase — and they use our integrated Marketplace Monetization capabilities to simplify the process and speed up procurement and sales cycles. Some even leverage Marketplace Monetization exclusively to avoid having to build, manage or maintain their own billing and payment infrastructure. Let’s take a closer look at Snowflake’s monetization options, how providers can maximize their listing flexibility, and why both providers and their customers benefit from simplifying access to the latest data, services and apps.\nSection Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nMarketplace Monetization allows providers to sell their products to Snowflake customers and invoice them directly through Snowflake. Because they’re purchasing through an already-known vendor, customers can avoid the potentially lengthy process of vetting, onboarding and verifying security policies for a new vendor and start using the data products right away. Shortening the sales, procurement and contracting cycle translates into faster time to value — which is good news for both customers and providers. Customers can also easily pay their Snowflake Marketplace invoice via electronic fund transfer, credit card payment or even with their Snowflake capacity commitment (via Marketplace Capacity Drawdown for eligible customers). The customer’s monetary payment is disbursed directly to the provider. Pricing is, of course, controlled and defined by the provider.\nSection Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nIt can be custom and privately available/visible for select customers, or be made more general for standardized products that are publicly available. Snowflake offers a multitude of monetization models from pay-as-you-go usage that is based on consumption to all-you-can-eat subscription-based models. No matter which model they use, providers can port their pricing and monetization strategy directly to Snowflake without worrying about pricing strategy mismatch across channels. (Please note: Snowflake currently only supports USD-based pricing for Marketplace Monetization.) Understandably, customers may hesitate to pay for a data product without a chance to “kick the tires” a bit and properly evaluate the solution. Snowflake Marketplace takes care of this with several options to allow customers to try out a listing before purchasing: * Time-limited trials\nSection Title: ... > What is Marketplace Monetization?\nContent:\nLimited functionality trials, analogous to the “freemium” model common to SaaS products\nUsage-based trials (currently in private preview)\nMany successful providers publish public paid listings with free trials on Snowflake Marketplace to create awareness with new and existing customers. This strategy allows them to address the self-service customer segments while still generating leads for upselling and creating opportunities for private conversations about customized products. One of the most valuable features of Snowflake’s monetization capabilities, in my opinion, is that Snowflake shares end-to-end analytics back to providers.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > What monetization models are available?\nContent:\nThere are two monetization models available: usage-based and subscription. Our **usage-based pricing model** allows providers to lower barriers to entry for consumers (also one of the reasons why Snowflake employs usage-based pricing). They can start using your products and get value immediately, without committing to long-term contracts. Examples here include pricing per query or per month when usage occurs. Snowflake Native Apps also have an exclusive usage-based pricing model: custom event billing (currently in public preview). This API-based billing allows providers to charge and meter based on nearly any value their app offers. For example, you can specify billing events in your app code and charge consumers based entirely on their usage of your application. This is a flexible, usage-based pricing model to allow providers to price-to-value their applications.\nSection Title: ... > What monetization models are available?\nContent:\nCommon examples include: * Price by the number of rows/bytes ingested or number of output rows by the application, such as data clean rooms and applications that enrich data\nSection Title: ... > What monetization models are available?\nContent:\nPrice by number of monthly active rows ingested by the application, such as ETL and reverse ETL\nPrice by number of unique users using the application\nAs the consumer expands their use of and gets more value from the data product or app, providers may want to implement a **subscription-based pricing model** to give these customers more predictable pricing. Snowflake offers recurring and non-recurring subscription models — with term duration ranging from a single month to many months to multiple years — with a pay up front for access or pay later option. Subscription payments can be made even more flexible with the option to pay via installments over the duration of the term. You can configure the subscription to allow portions of the payment to be front-loaded, back-loaded or spread evenly throughout the subscription term depending on the customer’s preferences and the provider’s needs.\nSection Title: ... > What monetization models are available?\nContent:\nAnd, of course, all of the backend processes are handled by Snowflake Marketplace Monetization without additional overhead for the provider.\nSection Title: ... > Learn more about monetizing data products and services on Snowflake Marketplace\nContent:\nThe Snowflake platform offers built-in capabilities that simplify the process of turning your data and apps into fully monetized, revenue-generating assets. To learn more, application developers and builders can check out the monetization module of the Snowflake Native App Bootcamp .

The same flexibility of the Snowflake Marketplace, however, can make it difficult for newcomers to navigate as they begin to build a monetization strategy that aligns with their business model.\nIn this short guide, we will explore the different pricing models offered on the Snowflake Marketplace and provide valuable insights on how to maximize return on investment for your Native App.\nSection Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide > Understanding the Snowflake Marketplace\nContent:\nThe [Snowflake Marketplace](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/marketplace/) serves as a dynamic ecosystem where providers showcase Snowflake-native applications, enabling users to discover and utilize data-driven solutions without requiring providers to move or provide external access to their data. It functions as a bridge between the creators of data products and their prospective consumers, offering a platform for the latter to try out or purchase data, applications, or AI solutions.\nSection Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide > Understanding the Snowflake Marketplace\nContent:\nThis digital marketplace not only facilitates data monetization, but also enhances the visibility of Native Apps to a broader audience of Snowflake users, which in turn amplifies potential revenue streams. It’s a space where the value of data products is recognized and can be effectively commercialized, making it an essential avenue for developers and companies aiming to capitalize on their data-centric applications.\nSection Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide > The Two Main Pricing Models Explained\nContent:\nIn the Snowflake marketplace, providers have the flexibility to select between two distinct pricing models tailored to accommodate the diverse needs of their consumers and the nature of their offerings.\nThe first model, known as the **usage-based plan** , operates on a pay-as-you-go principle where consumers are billed retrospectively for their actual usage over any given month. This model is particularly appealing for apps whose usage may vary significantly over time, offering a cost-effective solution for consumers while allowing providers to align their revenue with the app’s consumption levels.\nSection Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide > The Two Main Pricing Models Explained\nContent:\nConversely, the **subscription-based plan** provides a more predictable payment model where consumers commit to a fixed term, typically benefiting from uninterrupted access to the application. This model can include options for recurring billing, facilitating a consistent revenue stream for providers with data products that see more consistent, higher volume use. This model is well-suited for apps that offer ongoing value or require regular engagement, thereby encouraging long-term commitments from buyers.\nBoth of these models present unique advantages, making it crucial for providers to carefully assess their app’s characteristics and customer usage patterns when choosing the most appropriate pricing strategy.\nSection Title: ... > Choosing the Right Pricing Model for Your Native App\nContent:\nSelecting an optimal pricing model for your Native App in the Snowflake marketplace demands a strategic approach.\nIt’s crucial to understand your app’s utility and how your target customers will engage with it. If your app’s usage is expected to fluctuate, offering a usage-based plan might align better with your users’ needs, providing them with the flexibility to pay according to their consumption. This model is beneficial for encouraging trials and adoption, as it lowers the entry barrier for potential customers wary of making a significant upfront investment.\nSection Title: ... > Choosing the Right Pricing Model for Your Native App\nContent:\nOn the other hand, if your app delivers continuous value, such as regular data insights or ongoing service enhancements, a subscription-based model could be more fitting. This approach assures a predictable revenue stream and can help build customer loyalty by establishing long-term relationships. It’s particularly effective for apps that are integral to users’ daily operations or decision-making processes.\nIn making your decision, it’s imperative to also analyze your competitive environment. Understanding how similar apps are priced and the preferences of your target market can offer invaluable insights. Additionally, consider the perceived value of your app. Pricing too low might undervalue your offering, while too high a price could deter potential users. Finding the right balance is key to ensuring your pricing model supports both user acquisition and revenue growth.\nSection Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide > Maximizing Revenue with Strategic Pricing\nContent:\nTo ensure your Native App achieves its revenue potential on the Snowflake marketplace, a nuanced approach to pricing is paramount.\nThis means moving beyond merely setting a price to embracing a comprehensive strategy that includes engaging with the marketplace dynamics, understanding the needs of your audience, and aligning your pricing with the value delivered.\nOne key element of this process involves using market research to identify trends and preferences, ensuring your app’s pricing is competitive while adequately reflecting its unique value proposition. Experimentation also plays a critical role. Additionally, leveraging analytics to monitor how pricing changes affect user acquisition and retention can provide actionable insights, enabling ongoing optimization.\nSection Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide > Maximizing Revenue with Strategic Pricing\nContent:\nBy adopting a data-driven and flexible approach to pricing, you can adjust your strategies in response to market feedback, competitive pressures, and evolving consumer needs, ensuring your pricing strategy remains both appealing to users and conducive to your revenue goals.\nSection Title: ... > Monetizing Your Native Apps in Snowflake with Hakkōda\nContent:\nNavigating the monetization landscape of the Snowflake marketplace can be challenging, especially for organizations new to data product offerings or assetizing their existing data.

That calculus has evolved for most organizations, because in today’s business environment, data is money. Data is the lifeblood of the modern business because of the extreme value it represents at all stages of commerce. Data about historical sales helps drive decisions about where to invest in the future. Data about how customers use a product helps determine what features to prioritize next. Data about customer demographics and their personal preferences helps direct hypertargeted marketing campaigns, boosting revenues. Put simply, in every area of sales and marketing operations, data has become essential. Smart business leaders have figured this out. They’re no longer merely collecting data about their sales and customers, they’re actively using that data to create measurable business value and build a competitive advantage.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > What Is Data Monetization?\nContent:\nBroadly, data monetization is the practice of using information to generate measurable economic benefits. More specifically, it involves identifying valuable data and either [selling that data to others](https://www.snowflake.com/en/fundamentals/uniting-data-providers-apps-and-marketplaces-for-business-intelligence/) , using that data for direct marketing or leveraging data-based products to create new revenue streams.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Why Is Data Monetization Important?\nContent:\nWhile monetizing data used to be exclusive to the world of tech giants and global conglomerates with sophisticated data science programs, today the world of data monetization has become democratized. Any organization looking to thrive can now create a data monetization strategy, using it to open up new revenue streams, enhance the customer experience or gain a competitive advantage in its industry, whether it’s [telecommunications](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/telecom/) , [financial services](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/financial-services/) , [media](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/advertising-media-entertainment/) or something else.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\nContent:\nSo you want to start turning data into value in your own organization? Organizations can take one or more strategic pathways on the road to monetizing data. The correct path depends on your organization’s industry, your business goals and the type of data you have available. Here are the four primary strategies that organizations can use to monetize their data assets. #### 1. Selling raw or aggregated data Perhaps the most foundational type of data monetization, the simplest method to turn data into money is to sell it directly, for example on a [marketplace](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/marketplace/snowflake-marketplace-for-providers/) .\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\nContent:\nData about your customers has value to other businesses who want to reach them, either in the form of customer records with detailed contact information and data around their purchasing habits — or in the aggregate, where information is anonymized and consolidated through statistical methods. Raw customer data tends to be more valuable since it can be used as a direct sales lead, but this kind of data is subject to myriad privacy laws globally and may require customers to “opt in” to data sharing. This data can also be anonymized to disguise the actual identity of the customer ( [data clean rooms](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/data-clean-rooms/) can be a helpful tool for this sort of task, for example). Aggregated data, which does not include personally identifiable information about the customer, carries less of a compliance risk, but typically also holds less value.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\nContent:\nIn either case, a data monetization market can be helpful as an additional revenue stream. #### 2. Offering \"Data as a Service\" (DaaS) Data as a Service is an emerging business model that makes data available to customers on demand. DaaS services may be built around similar data types to those outlined in the previous section, but DaaS can offer advantages in both speed and data quality. With DaaS, data is available at the ready for customers to access any time and in an API-enabled format that can integrate directly into a workflow. DaaS systems also often include automated data management tools that improve data integrity and quality over what traditional data platforms (such as CRM systems) can offer. #### 3. Providing analytics and insights If you can’t (or don’t want to) sell the data itself, you can analyze that data and sell information derived from it.\nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > How to Monetize Data: 4 Major Strategies\nContent:\nThis is of course the primary business model for analyst firms, which collect data and then sell the reports they generate after analyzing it. Insights into customer and market trends can be of great value to other companies operating in the same industry or a related one. #### 4. Offering data-enhanced products and services A final data monetization strategy is to use data to upgrade the products or services you already provide or to improve the way they are sold. This could take the form of creating a personalized product, such as a bespoke fitness program designed for an individual customer based on data about their particular health needs. Or it could include designing upsell/cross-sell activities, such as the data-driven recommendations to purchase related products that are common on online [retail](https://www.snowflake.com/en/solutions/industries/retail-consumer-goods/) websites.\n ... \nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Use Cases and Examples of Data Monetization\nContent:\nMany [retailers](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/retail-media-data-clean-room-assets-permissions/) , especially grocery stores, use loyalty programs to closely track what a customer buys, helping them plan promotions and optimize inventory. #### In financial services All those credit card offers you receive in the mail aren’t generated arbitrarily. They’re the result of financially driven data monetization strategies that target customers based on an analysis of their purchasing habits and credit history. Data models can help prioritize the customers with the highest potential value and the lowest risk, and financial institutions use this data to target those customers with personalized financial products.\n ... \nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Data Monetization Resources\nContent:\n[feature ##### Snowflake Data Clean Rooms Explore the feature](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/data-clean-rooms/)\n[feature ##### Snowflake Horizon Catalog Explore the feature](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/horizon/)\n[feature ##### Snowflake Marketplace for Consumers Explore the feature](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/marketplace/snowflake-marketplace-for-providers/)\n[ebook ##### 50 Essential Apps, AI and Data Products on Snowflake Marketplace Get the ebook](https://www.snowflake.com/en/lp/essential-apps-ai-data-products/)\n[ebook ##### Snowflake Marketplace Guide 2025: Financial Services Get the ebook](https://www.snowflake.com/resource/snowflake-marketplace-guide-financial-services/)\n ... \nSection Title: Understanding Data Monetization > Data Monetization Resources > Related Content\nContent:\nReal-World Use Cases & Examples Explore the top AI applications and the best AI apps available today.

For additional information, see Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions .\nThis topic provides general information about the Snowflake Native App Framework.\nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > Introduction to the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶\nContent:\nThe Snowflake Native App Framework allows you to create data applications that leverage core Snowflake functionality.\nThe Snowflake Native App Framework allows you to:\nExpand the capabilities of other Snowflake features by sharing data and related\nbusiness logic with other Snowflake accounts. The business logic of an application can include a Streamlit app,\nstored procedures, and functions written using Snowpark API ,\nJavaScript, and SQL.\nShare an application with consumers through listings. A listing can be either free or paid.\nYou can distribute and monetize your apps in the Snowflake Marketplace or distribute them to\nspecific consumers using private listings.\nInclude rich visualizations in your application using Streamlit.\nThe Snowflake Native App Framework also supports an enhanced development experience that provides:\nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > Introduction to the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶\nContent:\nA streamlined testing environment where you can test your applications from a single account.\nA robust developer workflow. While your data and related database objects remain within Snowflake,\nyou can manage supporting code files and resources within source control using your preferred\ndeveloper tools.\nThe ability to release versions and patches for your application that allows you, as a provider,\nto change and evolve the logic of your applications and release them incrementally to consumers.\nSupport for logging of structured and unstructured events so that you can troubleshoot and monitor\nyour applications.\nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > Components of the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶\nContent:\nThe following diagram shows a high-level view of the Snowflake Native App Framework.\nThe Snowflake Native App Framework is built around the concept of provider and consumer used by other\nSnowflake features, including Snowflake Collaboration and Secure Data Sharing\nProvider\nA Snowflake user who wants to share data content and application logic with other Snowflake users.\nConsumer\nA Snowflake user who wants to access the data content and application logic shared by providers.\n ... \nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > ... > Publish an Application Package ¶\nContent:\nAfter developing and testing an application package, a provider can share an application with consumers by\npublishing a listing containing the application package as the data product of a listing. The listing can be a Snowflake Marketplace\nlisting or a private listing.\nSnowflake Marketplace listing\nAllows providers to market applications across the Snowflake Data Cloud. Offering a listing on the Snowflake Marketplace\nlets providers share applications with many consumers simultaneously, rather than maintain\nsharing relationships with each individual consumer.\nPrivate listing\nAllows providers to take advantage of the capabilities of listings to share applications directly with another\nSnowflake account in any Snowflake region supported by the Snowflake Native App Framework.\nSee About listings for details.\nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > ... > Install and Manage an Application ¶\nContent:\nAfter a provider publishes a listing containing an application package, consumers can discover the listing and\ninstall the application.\nSnowflake Native App\nA Snowflake Native App is the database object installed in the consumer account. When a consumer installs the Snowflake Native App,\nSnowflake creates the application and runs the setup script to create the required objects within the application.\nSee Install and test an app locally for details.\nAfter installing the application, consumers can perform additional tasks, including:\n[Enable logging and event sharing](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/native-apps/consumer-enable-logging) to help providers troubleshoot the application.\n[Grant privileges required by the application](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/native-apps/consumer-granting-privs) .\nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > ... > Install and Manage an Application ¶\nContent:\nSee [Working with Applications as a Consumer](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/native-apps/consumer-about) for details on how consumers install and manage an application.\nSection Title: ... > About Snowflake Native Apps with Snowpark Container Services ¶\nContent:\nA Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services (app with containers) is a Snowflake Native App that runs container workloads in Snowflake.\nContainer apps can run any containerized service supported by Snowpark Container Services.\nApps with containers leverage all of the features of the Snowflake Native App Framework, including provider IP protection, security\nand governance, data sharing, monetization, and integration with compute resources.\nLike any Snowflake Native App, an app with containers is comprised of an application package and application\nobject. However, there are some differences as shown in the following image:\nSection Title: ... > About Snowflake Native Apps with Snowpark Container Services ¶\nContent:\nApplication package:\nTo manage containers, the application package must have access to a services specification file on a\nstage. Within this file, there are references to the container images required by the app. These images\nmust be stored in an image repository in the provider account.\nApplication object:\nWhen a consumer installs an app with containers, the application object that is created contains a\ncompute pool that stores the containers required by the app.\nCompute pool:\nA compute pool is a collection of one or more virtual machine (VM) nodes on which Snowflake runs your\nSnowpark Container Services jobs and services. When a consumer installs an app with containers, they can\ngrant the CREATE COMPUTE POOL privilege to the app or they can create the compute pools manually.\nSection Title: ... > Protect provider intellectual property in an app with containers ¶\nContent:\nWhen an app with containers is installed in the consumer account, the query history of the services\nis available in the consumer account. To protect a provider’s confidential information, the Snowflake Native App Framework redacts\nthe following information:\nThe query text is hidden from the QUERY_HISTORY view .\nAll information in the ACCESS_HISTORY view is hidden.\nThe Query Profile graph for the service’s query is collapsed\ninto a single empty node instead of displaying the full query profile tree.\nSection Title: ... > Multi-factor requirements for users in a provider account ¶\nContent:\nDepending on the type of user, Snowflake requires different types of authentication for\nusers in the provider account.\nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > ... > Non-service users ¶\nContent:\nSnowflake recommends that users in a provider account enroll in multi-factor authentication (MFA) if they do not have the TYPE property set to SERVICE. In a future update, multi-factor\nauthentication will be mandatory for these types of users. Non-service users who use federated authentication and single sign-on (SSO)\nmust have MFA enabled as part of their authentication process.\nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > ... > Service users ¶\nContent:\nUsers who have the TYPE parameter set to SERVICE must use key-pair authentication or OAuth .\nWas this page helpful?\nYes No\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\nShare your feedback\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\nOn this page\nIntroduction to the Snowflake Native App Framework\nComponents of the Snowflake Native App Framework\nAbout Snowflake Native Apps with Snowpark Container Services\nProtect provider intellectual property in an app with containers\nMulti-factor requirements for users in a provider account\nRelated content\nSnowflake Native App Framework workflow\nTutorial 1: Create a basic Snowflake Native App\nSnowflake Native Apps commands\nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > Privacy Preference Center\nContent:\nYour Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored\nYour Privacy\nStrictly Necessary Cookies\nPerformance Cookies\nFunctional Cookies\nTargeting Cookies\n ... \nSection Title: About the Snowflake Native App Framework ¶ > ... > Your Privacy > Functional Cookies\nContent:\nFunctional Cookies\nThese cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation.
