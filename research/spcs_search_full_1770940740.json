Deploy real-time inference services with REST endpoints or fine-tune LLMs on proprietary data using GPUs. **Bring-Your-Own-Language** — Maybe you have C++ or R code that processes data. Package it into a container and run it on Snowflake data. Even COBOL or Java/.NET jobs can run inside Snowpark Container Services. **External Caches or DBs** — If you use a specialized store (like a vector database, Redis cache, or any microservice), you can run it as a container next to your Snowflake data. **ETL and Pipeline** — Instead of extracting to an external server, write your ETL logic as a container. It can pull raw data from a stage, transform it and load it into tables, all on Snowflake machines. **Full-Stack Apps and Tools** — You could even run tools like Metabase or Grafana in Snowpark Container Services.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > **Service types: Services vs Jobs vs Service Functions**\nContent:\n**Snowflake Service functions** are function as a service endpoints exposed by a service. A service implements a REST POST endpoint; a SQL-level function is then defined to call that endpoint. Calls follow the external function call pattern but execute inside Snowflake’s network boundary so your data does not leave Snowflake.\n**TL;DR:**\nService = always on and auto restarting.\nSnowflake Job service = run to completion, optionally parallel.\nSnowflake Service function = callable, data local function exposed to SQL.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services **Compute Pool Costs**\nContent:\nCompute pool is a cluster of one or more nodes running your containers. Each node is an instance with a fixed vCPU/memory profile. Snowflake assigns a **credit rate per hour** to each instance type. To get dollars per hour, multiply the credits by your Snowflake edition’s price-per-credit. On-demand credits are:\n**~$2** each in Standard US East;\n**~$3** in Enterprise;\n**~$4** in Business Critical;\nSnowpark Container Services offers several instance families.\n**CPU instances (X64)** – general-purpose. ( `XS` , `S` , `M` , `SL` , `L` sizes.)\n**High-Memory CPU** – more RAM for each CPU ( `S` , `M` , `SL` , `L` ).\n**GPU instances** – for GPU-accelerated workloads (NVIDIA-based families like `NV_XS` , `NV_S` , `NV_SM` , `NV_L` , `NV_2M` , `NV_3M` , plus `Google L4/A100` variants).\nEach has a fixed credits-per-hour rate. From [Snowflake’s consumption tables](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) .\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Storage and Volume Costs\nContent:\nIf you configure services to store local container logs in Snowflake tables (so-called *event tables* ), that data simply counts as table storage. You pay the usual storage rate on those logs.\n**➥ Volume mounts**\nSnowpark lets you mount volumes into containers. If you mount a **Snowflake stage as a volume** , again you pay stage costs as above. If you mount the Snowflake **compute pool’s local storage** as a volume, there’s *no extra charge* beyond the compute node cost. It’s “free” in the sense that you’ve already paid for the node’s cost.\n**Block storage (persistent volumes)**\nIf you want persistent disk beyond ephemeral, Snowpark Containers Service offers block storage volumes (backed by cloud block storage). These are metered in four ways: **Volume size (TB-month)** , **IOPS usage** , **Throughput** and **Snapshot storage.**\nSnowflake Snowpark Container Service Block Storage Pricing\nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Storage and Volume Costs\nContent:\nIn summary, for storage: **standard Snowflake storage** **prices apply** for anything on stages or tables. Container-specific extras come from block volumes. Those volumes are fairly expensive (on the order of $82–$100 per TB-month) but give you persistent disk. Don’t forget: all these storage costs run monthly (so divide by ~730 to get a “per hour” sense if needed).\nSo, a quick note on storage: if you’ve got data stored on stages or tables, you’ll be charged the standard rates. And if you’re using containers, you’ll also need to pay for block volumes on top of that. Those block volumes are fairly expensive, with a price tag of around **~$82-$100 per terabyte per month** . Just remember, these costs are monthly, so if you’re looking for an hourly breakdown, you can divide by 730 to get an estimate.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Snowpark Container Services Data Transfer Costs\nContent:\nOn AWS, Snowflake does **not** charge for data transfer within the same region (aside from a special SPCS fee, see below).\nTransfer to a different AWS region is about **$20/TB** .\nOn Azure, inter-region (same continent) is **~$20/TB** , cross-continent up to **~$50/TB** .\n**➥ Snowpark Container Services internal data transfer**\nWhen containers move data between compute (within Snowflake), Snowflake applies a nominal fee *even if staying in the same region* . On AWS, Snowpark Container Services data transfers in the same region cost ~ **$3.07 per TB** . It’s a small fee to account for internal network traffic. Also note that, Snowflake *caps* these SPCS transfer fees: any given day, your SPCS data transfer charge will be reduced by up to 10% of that day’s compute cost. In effect, you never pay SPCS transfer that exceeds 10% of compute spend, which keeps it modest.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowpark Container Services 101: A comprehensive overview (2026) > Conclusion\nContent:\nAnd that’s a wrap! Snowpark Container Services lets you run your containers inside Snowflake, so your code and data stay together under one security and governance umbrella. It’s essentially a “data-center-less” or “serverless” version of Kubernetes. Now that you’ve thoroughly followed the steps above, you can now easily push images and run microservices, APIs, or ML inference without having to copy huge amounts of data to external storage. No more jumping between different platforms and environments or worrying about moving massive datasets. Snowpark Container Services has you covered.\nIn this article, we have covered:\nWhat is Snowpark Container Services?\nHow Snowpark Container Services Works (Architecture & Core Components)\nStep-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Snowpark Container Services\nSnowpark Container Services Cost Breakdown\nQuick Tips and Best Practices\n… and so much more!\nSection Title: Snowpark Container Services 101: A comprehensive overview (2026) > Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nContent:\n**What is the difference between Snowflake and Snowpark?**\nSnowflake is the overall cloud data platform (storage + compute + services). **Snowpark** is Snowflake’s developer framework (libraries and APIs) for running custom code inside Snowflake. *Snowpark Container Services* is a feature of Snowpark that allows full Docker containers in the platform, extending beyond SQL or DataFrame UDFs.\n**What is Snowpark Container Services?**\nSnowpark Container Services (SPCS) is a fully managed container runtime within Snowflake that lets you deploy and scale containerized applications without moving data. It provides compute pools, image registries and container orchestration while maintaining Snowflake’s security and governance model.\n**Do I need a separate cloud account (AWS/GCP/Azure) to use Snowpark Container Services?**\n ... \nSection Title: Snowpark Container Services 101: A comprehensive overview (2026) > Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nContent:\nSnowpark Container Services is available on all paid Snowflake editions in commercial regions. It is not available on trial or free-tier accounts.  In 2024 it launched on AWS, then Azure GA (Feb 2025) and Google Cloud GA (Aug 2025). So if you have a standard Enterprise or Business Critical account (non-trial) on AWS, Azure, or GCP, you should have SPCS.\n**What is a compute pool and how to size it?**\nSnowflake compute pool is a collection of virtual machine nodes that run your containers. You can size it up based on your workload’s CPU, memory and GPU requirements. Start with CPU_X64_S instances and scale up based on actual resource utilization rather than over-provisioning from the start.\n**Does Snowflake charge for idle containers?**\n ... \nSection Title: Snowpark Container Services 101: A comprehensive overview (2026) > Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nContent:\n[Kubernetes pods vs containers: 4 key differences and how they work together](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/kubernetes-architecture-kubernetes-pods-vs-containers-4-key-differences-and-how-they-work-together/ \"Kubernetes pods vs containers: 4 key differences and how they work together\")\n[AWS cost optimization tools and tips: Ultimate guide [2025]](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/aws-cost-optimization-8-tools-and-tips-to-reduce-your-cloud-costs/ \"AWS cost optimization tools and tips: Ultimate guide [2025]\")\n[Optimize cloud costs: Using automation to avoid waste](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/optimize-cloud-costs-using-automation-to-avoid-waste/ \"Optimize cloud costs: Using automation to avoid waste\")\n[FinOps for AI: Governing the unique economics of intelligent\n ... \nSection Title: ... > [Cloud Cost Optimization demo](https://info.flexera.com/CM-DEMO-Cloud-Cost-Optimization-Req...\nContent:\nFebruary 22, 2023\nFinOps"]},{"url":"https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides/well-architected-framework-cost-optimization-and-finops/","title":"Cost Optimization - Snowflake","excerpts":["Section Title: Cost Optimization > Recommendations\nContent:\n**Deliver clear, historical consumption insights:** Utilize\nconsistent in-tool visualizations or custom dashboards to monitor\nconsumption and contextualize spend on the platform with unit\neconomics. **Investigate anomalous consumption activity:** Review anomaly\ndetection to identify unforeseen cost anomalies and investigate\ncause and effect trends. **Control**\n**Proactively monitor all platform usage:** Define and enforce\nbudgets for projects and services, setting soft quotas to limit\nresource consumption and prevent runaway spending. **Forecast consumption based on business needs:** Establish a\nforecast process to project future spend needs based on business and\ntechnical needs. **Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources:** Set up\nautomated checks (e.g., Tasks, query insights) and resource\nguardrails (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies, resource\nmonitors) to identify unusual usage patterns and potential\noverspending as they occur.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Recommendations\nContent:\n**Govern resource creation and administration:** Establish clear\nguidelines and automated processes for provisioning and maintaining\nresources, ensuring that only necessary and appropriately sized\nresources are deployed (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies,\nresource monitors). **Optimize**\n**Compute workload-aligned provisioning:** Continuously monitor\nresource health metrics to resize and reconfigure to match actual\nworkload requirements. **Leverage managed services:** Prioritize fully managed Snowflake\nservices (e.g., Snowpipe, Auto-clustering, [Query Acceleration Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) )\nto offload operational overhead and often achieve better cost\nefficiency. **Data storage types & lifecycle management:** Utilize appropriate\nstorage types and implement appropriate storage configuration to\nright-size workloads to your storage footprint.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models\nContent:\nIt is essential to review Snowflake's billing models to align technical\nand non-technical resources on financial drivers and consumption\nterminology. Snowflake's elastic, credit-based consumption model charges\nseparately for compute (Virtual Warehouses, Compute Pools, etc),\nstorage, data transfer, and various serverless features (e.g., Snowpipe,\nAutomatic Clustering, Search Optimization, Replication/Failover, AI\nServices). Understanding the interplay of these billing types ensures\nyou can attribute costs associated with each category’s unique usage\nparameters. High-level categories are below.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models\nContent:\n**Compute (Virtual Warehouses, Snowpark Container Services, Openflow):** This is often the most dynamic and largest portion of\nSnowflake spend. Virtual Warehouses are billed per-second after an\ninitial 60-second minimum when active, with credit consumption\ndirectly proportional to warehouse size (e.g., an “X-Small” Gen1\nwarehouse consumes one credit per hour, a 'Small' consumes two credits\nper hour, doubling with each size increase) while SPCS (via [compute pools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) )\nare billed for all uptime with a minimum of five minutes. [Openflow](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/cost) is billed per second of runtime with a 60-second minimum.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models\nContent:\n**Storage:** Costs are based on the average monthly compressed data\nvolume stored, including active data, Time Travel (data retention),\nand Fail-safe (disaster recovery) data. The price per terabyte (TB)\nvaries by cloud provider and region. **Serverless features:** Snowflake Serverless features use resources\nmanaged by Snowflake, not the user, which automatically scale to meet\nthe needs of a workload. This allows Snowflake to pass on efficiencies\nand reduce platform administration while providing increased\nperformance to customers. The cost varies by feature and is outlined\nin Snowflake’s Credit Consumption Document . **Cloud services layer:** This encompasses essential background\nservices, including query compilation, metadata management,\ninformation schema access, access controls, and authentication.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models\nContent:\nUsage\nfor cloud services is only charged if the daily consumption of cloud\nservices exceeds 10% of the daily usage of virtual warehouses. **AI features:** Snowflake additionally offers artificial intelligence\nfeatures that run on Snowflake-managed compute resources, including\nCortex AISQL functions (e.g. COMPLETE, CLASSIFY, etc. ), Cortex\nAnalyst, Cortex Search, Fine Tuning, and Document AI. The usage of\nthese features, often with tokens, are converted to credits to unify\nwith the rest of Snowflake’s billing model. Details are listed in the\nCredit Consumption Document. **Data transfer:** Data transfer is the process of moving data into\n(ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models\nContent:\nThis generally happens via\negress on cross-region [data replication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-cost) , [copying into/out of stage, function calls](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/cost-understanding-data-transfer) ,\nand cross/same region [SPCS data transfer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) . Depending on the cloud provider and the region used during data\ntransfer, charges vary. **Data sharing & rebates:** Snowflake offers an opt-out Data\nCollaboration rebate program that allows customers to offset credits\nby data consumed with shared outside organizations.

Snowflake’s\ninnovative cloud architecture separates the cost of accomplishing any task into one of these\nusage types.\n\nCompute Resources\n    Using compute resources within Snowflake consumes Snowflake credits. The billed cost of using compute resources is\ncalculated by multiplying the number of consumed credits by the price of a credit. For the current price of a credit, see the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\n\nThere are three types of compute resources that consume credits within Snowflake:\n\n* **Virtual Warehouse Compute** : Virtual warehouses are user-managed compute resources that consume\n  credits when loading data, executing queries, and performing other DML operations. Because Snowflake utilizes per-second billing (with a\n  60-second minimum each time the warehouse starts), warehouses are billed only for the credits they actually consume when they are\n  actively working.\n* **Serverless Compute** : There are Snowflake features such as Search Optimization and Snowpipe that use Snowflake-managed compute\n  resources rather than virtual warehouses. To minimize cost, these serverless compute resources are automatically resized and scaled\n  up or down by Snowflake as required for each workload.\n* **Cloud Services Compute** : The cloud services layer of the Snowflake architecture consumes credits as it performs behind-the-scenes\n  tasks such as authentication, metadata management, and access control. Usage of the cloud services layer is charged only if the daily\n  consumption of cloud services resources exceeds 10% of the daily warehouse usage.\n\nFor more details about compute costs, see Understanding compute cost .\nStorage Resources\n    The monthly cost for storing data in Snowflake is based on a flat rate per terabyte (TB). For the current rate, which\nvaries depending on your type of account (Capacity or On Demand) and region (US or EU), see the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\n\nStorage is calculated monthly based on the average number of on-disk bytes stored each day in your Snowflake account.\n\nFor more details about storage costs, see Understanding storage cost .\nData Transfer Resources\n    Snowflake does not charge data ingress fees to bring data into your account, but does charge for data egress.\n\nSnowflake charges a per-terabyte fee when you transfer data from a Snowflake account into a different region on the same cloud platform or into a completely different cloud platform. This fee for data egress depends on the region where your Snowflake account is hosted. For details,\nsee the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\n\nFor more details about data transfer costs, see Understanding data transfer cost .\n\n## Total cost example ¶\n\nThe following example provides insight into the total cost in Snowflake to load and query data.\n\nSuppose an organization loads data constantly, 24x7. It has two different groups of users (Finance and Sales) using the database in\noverlapping, but different times of the day. It also runs a weekly batch report. This organization:\n\n* Uses the Standard Edition of Snowflake.\n* Stores an average of 65 TBs of compressed data (compare with 325 TB without compression).\n* Loads data 24x7x365. They use a Small Standard virtual warehouse for this purpose.\n* Enables seven finance users to work 5 days a week from 8am until 5pm using a Large Standard virtual warehouse.\n* Enables twelve sales users in different geographies to work a total of 16 hours a day (across Europe and the Americas), 5 days a\n  week using a Medium Standard virtual warehouse.\n* Runs a complex weekly report every Friday. This report takes approximately 2 hours to run on a 2X-Large standard warehouse.\n\n**Data Loading Requirements**\n\n|Parameter |Customer Requirement |Configuration |Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Loading Window |24 x 7 x 365 |Small Standard Virtual Warehouse (2 credits/hr) |1,488 credits\n(2 credits/hr x 24 hours per day x 31 days per month) |\n\n**Storage Requirements**\n\n|Data set size (per month) |65 TB (after compression) |\n| --- | --- |\n\n**Compute Requirements**\n\n|Parameter |Customer Requirement |Configuration |Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Finance Users |5 Users, 8am-5pm (9 hours) |Large Standard Virtual Warehouse (8 credits/hr) |1,440 credits (8 credits/hr x 9 hours per day x 20 days per month) |\n|Sales Users |12 Users, 16 hour time slot |Medium Standard Virtual Warehouse (4 credits/hr) |1,280 (4 credits/hr x 16 hours per day x 20 days per month) |\n|Complex Query Users |1 User, 2 hours/day |2X Standard Virtual Warehouse (32 credits/hr) |256 (32 credits/hr x 2 hours per day x 4 days per month) |\n\n**Total Cost**\n\n|Usage Type |Monthly Cost |Total Billed Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Compute Cost |4,464 credits (@ $2/credit) |$8928 |\n|Storage Cost |65 TB (@ $23/TB) |$1495 |\n|$10,423 |\n\n**Next Topics**\n\n* Understanding compute cost\n* Understanding storage cost\n* Understanding data transfer cost\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

The storage cost is based on the average monthly data storage consumption, which is calculated after data compression. Snowflake automatically compresses data when it is loaded into the system, which means that the actual storage space consumed may be less than the original data size. For example, if a customer loads 1TB of data into Snowflake, the compressed data might occupy less than 1TB of storage space. The compression ratios vary depending on the data types and patterns. Users are charged for the average amount of compressed data stored per month. To optimize storage costs, users should monitor their storage consumption and consider implementing data archiving or pruning strategies for infrequently accessed or historical data.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 2) Snowflake Virtual Warehouse Cost\nContent:\n| **Warehouse Types** | **X-Small** | **Small** | **Medium** | **Large** | **XL** | **2XL** | **3XL** | **4XL** | **5XL** | **6XL** |\n| Standard Warehouse | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | 128 | 256 | 512 |\n| Snowpark Optimized Warehouse | N/A | N/A | 6 | 12 | 24 | 48 | 96 | 192 | 384 | 768 |\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 2) Snowflake Virtual Warehouse Cost\nContent:\nSnowflake credits are billed for usage by the second, with a near-instant auto-stop and near-instant auto-resume feature that helps you avoid paying for resources you don’t need. Snowflake allows workloads to scale independently with their own dedicated compute resources and eliminates data silos for enhanced usability. All queries run automatically on the virtual warehouse, where launched and unused virtual warehouses can be suspended, halting charges for idle compute time. Suspending, resuming, increasing, or reducing compute resources is nearly instantaneous, allowing users to match their spending with actual usage without unexpected demand or capacity planning. Compared to other Cloud data platforms, the termination of services results in the automatic deletion of data from the warehouse, making it very time-consuming and costly if you happen to have to reload data later on.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 4) Snowpark Container Services Cost\nContent:\nSnowflake has introduced Snowpark Container Services, a fully managed container offering that allows running containerized workloads directly within the Snowflake ecosystem.

As organizations increasingly adopt containerized workloads for data processing, understanding how OpenFlow leverages SPCS becomes crucial for data engineers and architects. This comprehensive guide explores the architecture, deployment mechanics, and cost implications of running OpenFlow on SPCS.\n\n## What is OpenFlow SPCS Deployment?\n\nOpenFlow — Snowflake Deployment is a containerized approach to running data integration workloads directly within Snowflake’s infrastructure. Unlike traditional BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) deployments, SPCS deployments eliminate the need to manage your own Kubernetes clusters while providing enterprise-grade security, scalability, and integration with Snowflake’s data platform.\n\n## The Four-Pool Architecture\n\nWhen you deploy Openflow on SPCS, Snowflake automatically creates **four distinct compute pools** to handle different aspects of the deployment:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n## Runtime-to-Pool Mapping and Shared Resources\n\nOne of the most important concepts to understand is that **runtime pools are shared resources** . When you create multiple runtimes of the same type, they don’t get individual pools. Instead:\n\n* All Small runtimes share `INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_SMALL`\n* All Medium runtimes share `INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_MEDIUM`\n* All Large runtimes share `INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_LARGE`\n\n## Example Scenario:\n\nIf you create 3 Small runtimes with different configurations:\n\n* Runtime A: Min 1 node, Max 5 nodes\n* Runtime B: Min 2 nodes, Max 10 nodes\n* Runtime C: Min 1 node, Max 3 nodes\n\nAll three runtimes will share the `INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_SMALL` pool, and the pool will scale based on the **total demand** from all three runtimes combined.\n\n## Scaling Mechanics and Resource Allocation\n\n## Dynamic Scaling Behavior\n\nThe compute pools exhibit intelligent scaling characteristics:\n\n1. **Scale-to-Zero** : Runtime pools scale down to 0 instances after 600 seconds without demand\n2. **Demand-Driven** : Pools scale up based on CPU consumption and runtime requirements\n3. **Maximum Constraints** : Each pool has a hard limit of 50 instances\n4. **Instant Provisioning** : New instances are provisioned rapidly to meet demand spikes\n\n## Resource Efficiency Example\n\nConsider a Small runtime scaling from 1 to 50 nodes:\n\n**At 1 Node:**\n\n* Pool instances: 1 CPU\\_X64\\_S instance\n* Total available: 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM\n* Runtime usage: 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM\n\n**At 50 Nodes:**\n\n* Pool instances: 50 CPU\\_X64\\_S instances\n* Total available: 200 vCPUs, 800 GB RAM\n* Runtime usage: 50 vCPUs, 100 GB RAM\n\n## Cost Implications and Optimization Strategies\n\n## Understanding the Cost Structure\n\n**Continuous Costs:**\n\n* Control Pool: Always charges 1 CPU\\_X64\\_S instance-hour when deployment exists\n* Monthly baseline: ~720 CPU\\_X64\\_S instance-hours (24×30 days)\n\n**Variable Costs:**\n\n* Runtime pools: Scale based on actual usage\n* Charged per-second with 5-minute minimums\n* Different instance types have different hourly rates\n\n## Cost Optimization Strategies\n\n1. **Right-Size Runtime Types** : Choose the smallest runtime type that meets your performance needs\n2. **Optimize Scaling Configuration** : Set appropriate min/max node values to balance performance and cost\n3. **Consider Deployment Lifecycle** : Delete deployments when not in use to eliminate control plane charges\n4. **Monitor Usage Patterns** : Use account usage views to track consumption and identify optimization opportunities\n\n## Deployment Management Operations\n\n## Creating a Deployment\n\nOpenflow deployments can be created through:\n\n* Snowsight web interface\n* Snowflake CLI\n* REST APIs\n\n## Suspending vs. Deleting\n\n**Important** : There’s no “suspend” option for Openflow deployments. Your choices are:\n\n* **Active** : Control plane runs continuously, incurring charges\n* **Deleted** : Complete removal, all charges stop immediately\n\n## Monitoring and Observability\n\nSeveral account usage views provide insight into Openflow consumption:\n\n* `OPENFLOW_USAGE_HISTORY` : Runtime-specific usage tracking\n* `METERING_DAILY_HISTORY` : Daily aggregated consumption\n* `METERING_HISTORY` : Hourly consumption data\n\n## Best Practices for Production Deployments\n\n## 1\\. Capacity Planning\n\n* Estimate peak runtime requirements across all runtime types\n* Account for shared pool resource contention\n* Plan for control plane costs in total cost of ownership\n\n## 2\\. Security Considerations\n\n* Leverage Snowflake’s built-in RBAC for deployment access control\n* Use network policies to restrict connectivity\n* Implement proper secrets management for connectors\n\n## 3\\. Performance Optimization\n\n* Monitor CPU utilization across runtime pools\n* Adjust runtime min/max settings based on workload patterns\n* Consider data locality for optimal performance\n\n## 4\\. Cost Management\n\n* Implement tagging and cost allocation strategies\n* Set up alerting for unexpected usage spikes\n* Regular review of deployment necessity and utilization\n\n## **Comparison: SPCS vs. BYOC Deployments**\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n## Future Considerations\n\nAs OpenFlow SPCS continues to evolve, expect enhancements in:\n\n* More granular cost controls\n* Additional runtime type options\n* Enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities\n* Improved integration with Snowflake’s data governance features\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOpenFlow SPCS deployment represents a powerful paradigm for running containerized data workloads within Snowflake’s ecosystem. The four-pool architecture provides flexibility and scalability while the shared resource model ensures cost efficiency. However, success requires careful consideration of the cost implications, particularly the continuous control plane charges.\n\nFor organizations evaluating OpenFlow deployment options, SPCS offers reduced operational overhead at the cost of less infrastructure control. The decision ultimately depends on your organization’s priorities regarding operational complexity, cost structure, and integration requirements.\n\nUnderstanding these architectural details empowers data teams to make informed decisions about deployment strategies, capacity planning, and cost optimization in their OpenFlow implementations.\n\nSnowflake Data Cloud\n\nOpenflow\n\nSnowpark Container\n\nSnowpark\n\n\\-- \n\n\\--\n\n## Written by Karthick Ramamoorthy\n\n0 followers\n\n· 6 following\n\n## No responses yet\n\n[](https://policy.medium.com/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4?source=post_page---post_responses--e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)\n\n[Help](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us?source=post_page-----e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)\n\n[Status](https://status.medium.com/?source=post_page-----e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\n[Blog](https://blog.medium.com/?source=post_page-----e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)\n\n[Privacy](https://policy.medium.com/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9?source=post_page-----e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)\n\n[Rules](https://policy.medium.com/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4?source=post_page-----e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)\n\n[Terms](https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=post_page-----e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)\n\n[Text to speech](https://speechify.com/medium?source=post_page-----e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)"]},{"url":"https://keebo.ai/2025/01/28/snowflake-pricing/","title":"Snowflake Pricing Explained: Costs, Savings & 2025 Guide","publish_date":"2025-12-03","excerpts":["Section Title: ... > 1. Snowflake Pricing Introduction\nContent:\nThe landscape has changed significantly since Snowflake first emerged. As noted in a [recent analysis of cloud data warehousing trends](https://keebo.ai/2024/09/10/snowflake-query-performance/) , “the modern data stack requires a more nuanced approach to cost management than traditional on-premises systems ever did.” This sentiment particularly resonates with Snowflake implementations, where the very elasticity that makes the platform powerful can also make costs difficult to predict.\nWhether you’re a hands-on data engineer, an enterprise architect making strategic decisions, a FinOps specialist tasked with optimization, or simply someone trying to make sense of your organization’s Snowflake expenditure, my goal is to help you understand how Snowflake’s pricing truly works at a mechanical level—and more importantly, how to make that Snowflake pricing model work for you rather than against you.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Example 4: Serverless Feature Creep\nContent:\nA FinOps team enables **Search Optimization** and **Materialized Views** across several large tables during a schema redesign project.

It produces excellent Snowflake savings and can help with simplifying multiple operations. However, I routinely encounter staging areas containing tens of terabytes of CSV files from months-old integration tests, or Time Travel windows configured for maximum retention across all schemas—including those containing transient data.\nJust because storage isn’t your largest line item doesn’t mean it’s not worth optimizing. In organizations with large data volumes, even small percentage improvements can yield significant Snowflake savings.\nThese patterns appear consistently across the spectrum—from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 enterprises. What makes them particularly challenging is that they often remain undetected until they’ve been affecting costs for extended periods.\n ... \nSection Title: Appendix: Quick Reference for Snowflake Pricing > Glossary of Key Terms\nContent:\n| **Term** | **Definition** |\n| **Credit** | Snowflake’s fundamental unit of compute billing—applied to warehouses, services, and AI capabilities |\n| **Virtual Warehouse** | A compute cluster provisioned to process queries, sized from XS to 6XL |\n| **Auto-Suspend** | A warehouse configuration that determines idle time before automatic deactivation |\n| **Capacity Pricing** | Prepaid credits purchased at a discount compared to On-Demand rates |\n| **Time Travel** | A feature providing access to historical data states for specified retention periods |\n| **Fail-safe** | Snowflake’s disaster recovery mechanism for deleted data (7-day retention) |\n| **Serverless Feature** | Compute services that operate independently of user-managed warehouses |\n| **Snowpark Containers** | Managed compute environments for containerized applications |\n| **Cortex AI** | Snowflake’s integrated suite of LLM and generative AI capabilities |\n ... \nSection Title: ... > [Databricks Cost Optimization: Proven Strategies to Reduce Cloud Spending](https://keebo.ai...\nContent:\nJanuary 26, 2026\n[](https://keebo.ai/2025/12/02/snowpark-optimized-warehouse-resource-constraints/)"]},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/barzan-mozafari-433519a4_finops-snowflakeoptimization-databricks-activity-7371956425184694274-C_dH","title":"Why FinOps is more than just cost optimization - LinkedIn","excerpts":["Sep 11, 2025 · ...

While the core functionality remains consistent across platforms, there are slight differences in storage costs across platforms, though the main differences are in data transfer rates. AWS also has the most regions. For example, block storage pricing for Snowpark Container Services (SPCS) costs $81.92 per TB per month in the US East (Northern Virginia) Region for AWS, compared to $82.23 in the equivalent region, East US 2 (Virginia) for Azure. Transferring data from AWS's US East (Northern Virginia) Region to the internet costs $90 per TB. The same operation on Azure (East US 2 – Virginia) is slightly cheaper at $87.50 per TB.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Understanding Snowflake's Pricing Structure Snowflake prices its services according to actu...\nContent:\nData Transfer Costs While ingress to Snowflake is free, and transferring data within the same region and provider incurs no cost, certain features that involve data egress may have associated charges. It's vital to consult Snowflake's detailed pricing to understand potential egress fees. ### 8. Cloud Services Costs Snowflake's cloud services, covering non-storage and non-processing activities, employ a fair-use policy where usage of up to 10% of compute credits is included at no extra cost. This policy ensures that most customers won't incur additional charges, though extensive simple query executions might exceed this threshold. ### 5.

Standardize cost data using currency conversions for multi-region or global deployments. Map platform-specific resources and storage tiers (e.g., S3/Blob/GCP storage buckets, Snowflake storage, Databricks DBFS) to common logical groups.\n ... \nSection Title: Context for Building a FinOps Scope for Data Clouds > ... > Reporting & Analytics\nContent:\n**Build personas-based views:** Create customized, role-specific dashboards leveraging BI tools or native solutions (e.g., Snowflake dashboards, Databricks SQL Analytics, AWS QuickSight, Azure Power BI, Google Looker) for example: Engineers (e.g., top queries, job runtimes), finance (e.g., unit costs, spend trends), and product owners (e.g., cost per feature/team). **Enable self-service access:** Provide semantic models and query templates so stakeholders can explore their own cost and usage data without needing deep platform knowledge. **Unify metrics and units** – Normalize compute metrics to a standard cost-per-unit model for analysis (e.g., FOCUS consumed unit) so cross-platform reporting is comparable.\n ... \nSection Title: Context for Building a FinOps Scope for Data Clouds > Data Cloud Integration Patterns\nContent:\nTo apply FinOps to Data Clouds, it’s key to understand how your architecture affects costs. Many environments blend data warehouses, lakes, and lakehouses, often with overlapping tools in the wider technology data architecture. Without a clear view of how these systems connect, cost tracking and optimization become difficult.\nFinOps teams should map the full data architecture, highlight what’s integrated or siloed, and apply Data Cloud specific consideration of FinOps capabilities like allocation, forecasting, and optimization accordingly.\nMost organizations follow one of four common patterns:\nHub-and-Spoke: A central data lake feeds multiple tools.\nFederated: Independent data platforms with shared governance.\nConsolidated: One main platform to reduce complexity and cost.\nHybrid: On-prem systems integrated with cloud, mixing cost models.\nThese patterns shape pricing models and cost drivers.\n ... \nSection Title: Context for Building a FinOps Scope for Data Clouds > ... > Key for Data Cloud Platform Table\nContent:\n| ***Pricing Model*** | ***Applicability*** | ***Reason*** |\n| *Unit-Based (e.g. Cost per Query, per Job, per User)* | *Full* | *Common in analytics and ML workflows; aligns with granular billing for actions like queries, model runs, or API calls. Enables cost attribution at workload or user level.* |\n| *Consumption-Based (e.g. $/TB scanned, $/hour)* | *Full* | *Core model for many serverless and MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) services.
