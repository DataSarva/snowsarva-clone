But previously, developers didn’t have a centralized, straightforward way to capture application logs and traces.\nEnter the new Event Tables feature, which helps developers and data engineers easily instrument their code to capture and analyze logs and traces for all languages: Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python and Snowflake Scripting.\nSection Title: Collect Logs and Traces From Your Snowflake Applications With Event Tables\nContent:\nWith Event Tables, developers can instrument logs and traces from their UDFs, UDTFs, stored procedures, Snowflake Native Apps and Snowpark Container Services, then seamlessly route them to a secure, customer-owned Event Table. Developers can then query Event Tables to troubleshoot their applications or gain insights into performance and code behavior.\nLogs and traces are collected and propagated via Snowflake’s telemetry APIs, then automatically ingested into your Snowflake Event Table.\nSection Title: ... > Simplify troubleshooting in Snowflake Native Apps\nContent:\nEvent Tables are also supported for Snowflake Native Apps. When a Snowflake Native App runs, it is running in the consumer’s account, generating telemetry data that’s ingested into their active Event Table.\nOnce the consumer enables event sharing, new telemetry data will be ingested into both the consumer and provider Event Tables. Now the provider has the ability to debug the application that’s running in the consumer’s account. The provider only sees the telemetry data that is being shared from this data application—nothing else.\nSection Title: ... > Improve reliability across a variety of use cases\nContent:\nYou can use Event Tables to capture and analyze logs for various use cases: * As a data engineer building UDFs and stored procedures within queries and tasks, you can instrument your code to analyze its behavior based on input data.\nAs a Snowpark developer, you can instrument logs and traces for your Snowflake applications to troubleshoot and improve their performance and reliability.\nAs a Snowflake Native App provider, you can analyze logs and traces from various consumers of your applications to troubleshoot and improve performance.\nSection Title: ... > Improve reliability across a variety of use cases\nContent:\nSnowflake customers ranging from Capital One to phData are already using Event Tables to unlock value in their organization. “The Event Tables feature simplifies capturing logs in the observability solution we built to monitor the quality and performance of Snowflake data pipelines in Capital One Slingshot,” says Yudhish Batra, Distinguished Engineer, Capital One Software. “Event Tables has abstracted the complexity associated with logging from our data pipelines—specifically, the central Event Table gives us the ability to monitor and alert from a single location.”\nAs phData migrates its Spark and Hadoop applications to Snowpark, the Event Tables feature has helped architects save time and hassle.\n“When working with Snowpark UDFs, some of the logic can become quite complex. In some instances, we had thousands of lines of Java code that needed to be monitored and debugged,” says Nick Pileggi,\nPrincipal Solutions Architect at phData\nSection Title: ... > Improve reliability across a variety of use cases\nContent:\n. “Before Event Tables, we had almost no way to see what was happening inside the UDF and correct issues. Once we rolled out Event Tables, the amount of time we spent testing dropped significantly and allowed us to have debug and info-level access to the logs we were generating in Java.”\nOne large communications service provider also uses logs in Event Tables to capture and analyze failed records during data ingestion from various external services to Snowflake. And a Snowflake Native App provider offering geolocation data services uses Event Tables to capture logs and traces from their UDFs to improve application reliability and performance.\nWith Event Tables, you now have a built-in place to easily and consistently manage logging and tracing for your Snowflake applications. And in conjunction with other features such as Snowflake Alerts and Email Notifications, you can be notified of new events and errors in your applications.\n ... \nSection Title: Collect Logs and Traces From Your Snowflake Applications With Event Tables > ... > Share Article\nContent:\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.snowflake.com%2Fcontent%2Fsnowflake-site%2Fglobal%2Fen%2Fblog%2Fcollect-logs-traces-snowflake-apps&title=Collect+Logs+and+Traces+From+Your+Snowflake+Applications+With+Event+Tables)\n[](https://x.com/intent/post?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.snowflake.com%2Fcontent%2Fsnowflake-site%2Fglobal%2Fen%2Fblog%2Fcollect-logs-traces-snowflake-apps&text=Collect+Logs+and+Traces+From+Your+Snowflake+Applications+With+Event+Tables)\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.snowflake.com%2Fcontent%2Fsnowflake-site%2Fglobal%2Fen%2Fblog%2Fcollect-logs-traces-snowflake-apps)\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Alerts and Observability for Pipeline Monitoring and Cost Management\nContent:\nShiyi Gu\nNov 23, 2022 | 5 min read\nSubscribe to our blog newsletter\nGet the best, coolest and latest delivered to your inbox each week\nBy submitting this form, I understand Snowflake will process my personal information in accordance with their Privacy Notice."]},{"url":"https://www.metaplane.dev/snowflake-native-app","title":"Snowflake Native App - Metaplane","excerpts":["New Metaplane and Datadog join forces to bring software and data observability together.\nLearn More\nPlatform\nPlatform Overview Learn all about Metaplane\nData CI/CD Prevent data quality issues in PRs\nMonitoring and anomaly detection Be the first to know when something breaks\nSchema change alerts Increase awareness for the entire data team\nLineage and impact analysis Data pipeline visibility from source to usage\nJob monitoring Eliminate pipeline latency issues\nData Insights Explore how your data is being used\nAlerting One rally point for all of your stakeholders\nStart monitoring today Sign up, connect your tool(s) in minutes, and start monitoring right away.\nCustomers Pricing Integrations\nIntegrations\nIntegrations overview Learn all the tools Metaplane integrates with\nSection Title: DATA WAREHOUSES\nContent:\nBigQuery [Clickhouse](https://docs.metaplane.dev/docs/clickhouse) [Databricks](https://docs.metaplane.dev/docs/databricks) Redshift Snowflake [AWS S3](https://docs.metaplane.dev/docs/s3)\nSection Title: DATA WAREHOUSES > Ingestion\nContent:\nAirbyte Fivetran\nSection Title: DATA WAREHOUSES > Ingestion > Transformations\nContent:\ndbt Cloud dbt Core\nSection Title: DATA WAREHOUSES > Ingestion > Transformations > transactional databases\nContent:\nMySQL PostgreSQL SQL Server\nSection Title: DATA WAREHOUSES > Ingestion > Transformations > REVERSE ETL\nContent:\nCensus Hightouch\nSection Title: DATA WAREHOUSES > Ingestion > Transformations > notifications\nContent:\nJira\nSection Title: DATA WAREHOUSES > Ingestion > Transformations > orchestration\nContent:\nAirflow\nSection Title: DATA WAREHOUSES > Ingestion > Transformations > Business intelligence\nContent:\nLooker Metabase Mode PowerBI Sigma Tableau Hex\nResources\n[Docs Get started with Metaplane in under 15 minutes](https://docs.metaplane.dev/) Resource Library Webinars, podcasts, live events, and white paper downloads Changelog See the latest Metaplane product updates Data Observability Guides How to get started with the fundamentals of data observability Blog — In Data We Trust Guides and perspectives from data leaders\nBook a demo\nSnowflake Native App\nSection Title: Use your existing credits with our Snowflake Native App\nContent:\nAll of Metaplane’s robust data observability features, brought directly into your Snowflake environment.\nTalk to sales\nPay with credits\nSkip the procurement process\nHelping the world’s best data teams TRUST THEIR DATA\nSection Title: ... > Get our Snowflake native app and use your existing credits\nContent:\n[Setup now, for free](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZ7NSX7E/metaplane-metaplane-data-observability-platform)\nSection Title: ... > End-to-end observability inside Snowflake\nContent:\nAll of Metaplane’s robust data observability features brought directly into your Snowflake environment.\nSection Title: ... > Your data never leaves your warehouse\nContent:\nWith our native app, you can install monitors directly within your warehouse, helping keep your data all the more secure.\nSection Title: Use your existing credits with our Snowflake Native App > ... > Use your Snowflake credits\nContent:\nPay for monitors with your existing Snowflake credits and skip the extra procurement step.\nSection Title: ... > Without Metaplane, we wouldn’t be as proactive with data quality.

Its credit-based billing model is also directly recognized in the FOCUS specification, ensuring alignment with the industry’s standard for cloud cost and usage data. You can see the details of the FOCUS v1.2 spec [here](https://focus.finops.org/focus-specification/v1-2/) .\n*Note: At the time of writing, FOCUS v2.1 is the latest version. Snowflake mappings are still primarily aligned with v1.2, which means some newer dimensions (e.g., richer invoice identifiers, commitments) require external enrichment pipelines.*\n ... \nSection Title: ... > What is Possible in the Snowflake Portal\nContent:\nThe Snowflake web portal provides native visibility into cost and usage, enabling FinOps practices directly within the platform. From the Billing & Usage section, customers can download detailed usage statements that include credits consumed, billing currency, and invoiced amounts. These statements serve as the source of truth for financial reconciliation and can be mapped into the FOCUS specification for standardized reporting.\nIn addition, the portal exposes Snowsight dashboards for monitoring warehouse utilization, query activity, and service-level costs. Finance and engineering teams can leverage these dashboards to track trends, attribute spend, and spot anomalies without external tools. While deeper FinOps workflows may require exporting data to FOCUS-compliant pipelines, the portal ensures that organizations always have a clear, auditable view of Snowflake consumption and spend.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Common Metrics Often Analyzed in Snowflake Portal\nContent:\nSee the official [Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and [Datadog’s Snowflake metrics guide](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/snowflake-metrics) . **Storage & Data Usage Metrics\n** [Storage metrics](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com) include costs tied to staging, Time Travel retention, table sizes, and stage usage. These help identify underutilized storage and fine-tune retention policies.\nSection Title: ... > Why Build a Custom Cost Analytics App?\nContent:\nSnowflake’s native portal and Snowsight dashboards provide useful insights into usage, spend, and warehouse performance — great for quick checks and financial reconciliation. But when teams need interactive, FinOps-oriented analysis, a custom Streamlit app inside Snowflake delivers more. By combining live telemetry ( `ACCOUNT_USAGE` ) with pre-aggregated snapshots, applying cost-aware caching, and drilling into query-level cost drivers, the app goes beyond static reporting. It enforces permission checks, adds filters by service or warehouse, and surfaces the underlying SQL so Finance and Engineering share the same transparent view. In short, it transforms Snowflake telemetry into a collaborative cockpit for FinOps, aligning data with FOCUS dimensions and enabling actionable insights, accountability, and optimization at scale.\nDemo Environment:\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nDaily Trend\nSection Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake — Insights from a Streamlit App > A Few Useful Query Patterns\nContent:\n```\n-- Daily credits used by warehouse  \nSELECT  \n  WAREHOUSE_NAME,  \n  TO_DATE(START_TIME) AS USAGE_DATE,  \n  ROUND(SUM(CREDITS_USED), 3) AS WH_CREDITS  \nFROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  \nWHERE START_TIME >= '2025-08-29' AND START_TIME < '2025-08-30'  \n  --AND WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'MY_WH'  \nGROUP BY 1,2  \nORDER BY 2,1;\n```\n```\n-- Daily credits used across all warehouses  \nSELECT TO_DATE(START_TIME) AS USAGE_DATE, SUM(CREDITS_USED) AS DAILY_CREDITS  \nFROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  \nWHERE START_TIME >= '2025-08-29' AND START_TIME < '2025-08-30'  \nGROUP BY USAGE_DATE  \nORDER BY USAGE_DATE;\n```\n ... \nSection Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake — Insights from a Streamlit App > Summary\nContent:\nSnowflake already gives organizations powerful cost visibility through its portal, usage views, and Snowsight dashboards. But for teams adopting FinOps at scale, native reporting is just the starting point. By aligning Snowflake’s credit-based model with the FOCUS specification, and extending telemetry with a custom Streamlit app, companies can bridge the gap between financial governance and engineering workflows.\nThe result: a collaborative, cost-aware cockpit that empowers Finance, Engineering, and Product teams to share the same transparent view of usage, detect cost drivers early, and keep cloud spending predictable without slowing innovation.\nSection Title: FinOps Cost Management in Snowflake — Insights from a Streamlit App > 📚 Further Reading\nContent:\n[Deep Dive: Snowflake’s Query Cost Attribution — Greybeam Blog](https://blog.greybeam.ai/snowflake-cost-per-query)\nImplement Cost Monitoring Dashboards using Snowsight — Medium\nSnowflake Database — Account Usage & Information Schema — Medium\n[Optimize Snowflake Spend with the New Cost Management Interface — Snowflake Blog](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/optimize-spend-new-cost-management-interface/)\nMastering Snowflake Warehouse Utilization — Medium\n[A Deep Dive into Snowflake Storage Costs — Select.dev](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-storage)\n[Key Snowflake Metrics — Datadog Blog](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/snowflake-metrics/)\nFinops\nStreamlit App\nSnowflake\nCloud Computing\nData Analysis\n--\n--\n[](https://medium.com/snowflake?source=post_page---post_publication_info--92d74477c137---------------------------------------)"]},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/builders/observability","title":"Observability in Snowflake apps | Snowflake Documentation","excerpts":["Section Title: Observability in Snowflake apps ¶\nContent:\nThrough observability built into Snowflake, you can ensure that your applications are running as efficiently as possible.\nUsing the practices and features described in this topic, you can make the most of observability features that show you where you\ncan improve your code.\nSection Title: Observability in Snowflake apps ¶ > What is observability? ¶\nContent:\nIn an observable system, you can understand what’s happening internally through external evidence generated by the system—evidence\nthat includes telemetry data, alerts, and notifications.\nThrough the evidence of internal functioning it provides, observability makes it easier for you to troubleshoot hard-to-understand behaviors\non a production system. This is especially true in a distributed system, where evidence collected from observation provides a view of\nbehavior across multiple components. Rather than disrupting a production environment to diagnose issues, you can analyze the collected\ndata from it.\nWith an observable system, you can start to answer questions such as the following:\nHow well is the system performing?\nWhere is there latency and what’s causing it?\nWhy is a particular component or process not working as it should?\nWhat improvements can be made?\nSection Title: Observability in Snowflake apps ¶ > Observability in Snowflake ¶\nContent:\nSnowflake supports a model that provides built-in observable data while also giving you ways to add more instrumentation where you need it.\nWhile Snowflake provides support for telemetry data such as logs, metrics, and traces (which are typical of observability), it also\nincludes other features you can use to keep track of system usage and performance.\nThe following lists features you can use to receive and analyze system performance and usage.\n|Collected telemetry data |As your application generates logs, metrics, and traces, Snowflake collects that telemetry data in an event table.
