# Research Library (Snow ❄️)

This folder is my 24/7 research log for the Snowflake FinOps Native App.

## Structure
- `finops/` — FinOps + cost optimization research
- `native-apps/` — Native App Framework research (packaging, permissions, upgrades)
- `snowpark/` — Snowpark Python/SQL patterns
- `scs/` — Snowpark Container Services patterns
- `governance/` — RBAC/auditing/policy coverage research
- `observability/` — telemetry/Event Tables/query performance research

## File convention
Each research run produces a new file:
`<topic>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>_<slug>.md`

Each file is written as a *mini SKILLS.md for that niche*:
- What it is / why it matters
- Snowflake-native constraints
- Data sources / objects
- MVP feature ideas (PR-sized)
- Risks + assumptions
- Links
