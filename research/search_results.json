This proactive monitoring is\nessential for preventing budget overruns and identifying inefficiencies,\nshifting the organization from a reactive to a proactive cost management\nposture to mitigate financial risk. As a best practice, you should\ninitially review anomaly detection on the entire account to gain a broad\nview, then dive deeper into a more granular review for individual\nhigh-spend warehouses. [This approach](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies) allows for more targeted analysis and assigns clear ownership for\ninvestigating any flagged anomalies. There are several methods for\nanomaly detection supported by Snowflake:\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Investigate anomalous consumption activity\nContent:\nSnowsight, Snowflake's primary web interface, offers a dedicated Cost\nManagement UI that allows users to visually identify and analyze the\ndetails of any detected cost anomaly. The importance of this intuitive\nvisual interface lies in its ability to make complex cost data\naccessible to a wide range of stakeholders, enabling rapid root cause\nanalysis by correlating a cost spike with specific query history or user\nactivity. One of the tabs in this UI is the Cost Anomaly Detection tab,\nwhich enables you to view cost anomalies at the organization or account\nlevel and explore the top warehouses or accounts driving this change.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Investigate anomalous consumption activity\nContent:\nTo\nfoster a culture of cost awareness and accountability, it is a best\npractice to ensure there is an owner for an anomaly detected in the\naccount and set up a [notification (via email)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-ui) in the UI itself to ensure that cost anomalies are quickly and\naccurately investigated.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Investigate anomalous consumption activity\nContent:\n**Programmatic Cost Anomaly Detection**\nFor deeper integration and automation, organizations can review [anomalies programmatically](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-class) using the SQL functions and views available within the SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL\nschema. This approach is important for enabling automation and\nscalability, allowing cost governance to be embedded directly into\noperational workflows, such as feeding anomaly data into third-party\nobservability tools or triggering automated incident response playbooks.\nA key best practice is to utilize this programmatic access to build\ncustom reports and dashboards that align with specific financial\nreporting needs and to create advanced, automated alerting mechanisms\nthat pipe anomaly data into established operational channels, such as\nSlack or PagerDuty.\n**Custom Anomaly Detection & Notification**\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Investigate anomalous consumption activity\nContent:\nAlthough anomalies are detected at the account and organization level,\nif you desire to detect anomalies at lower levels (e.g. warehouse or\ntable), it is recommended to leverage Snowflake’s [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) ML class and pair it with a Snowflake [alert](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) to notify owners of more granular anomalies that occur within the\necosystem. This ensures all levels of Snowflake cost can be monitored in\na proactive and effective way."]},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection","title":"Anomaly Detection (Snowflake ML Functions) | Snowflake Documentation","excerpts":["Accounts\")\n[Business continuity & data recovery](/en/user-guide/replication-intro \"Business continuity & data recovery\")\n[Performance optimization](/en/guides-overview-performance \"Performance optimization\")\n[Cost & Billing](/en/guides-overview-cost \"Cost & Billing\")\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Overview [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nAnomaly detection is the process of identifying outliers in data.

Spotting and removing outliers can therefore\nhelp improve the quality of your results.\nNote\nAnomaly Detection is part of Snowflake’s suite of business analysis tools powered by machine learning.\nDetecting outliers can also be useful in pinpointing the origin of problems or deviations in processes when there is no\nobvious cause.

To simplify this, Snowflake has developed a powerful deep-dive analysis tool to help you understand and investigate consumption anomalies. This tool provides cost alerting and visibility, enabling you to take action when unforeseen consumption occurs to better manage your Snowflake costs. This tool, which was made available only to account admins in April 2025, is *now open to all Snowflake users through three new access roles that reflect common use cases. * ## Anomaly Insights We released [Anomaly Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies) to help businesses better understand their account and organization spending by flagging anomalous spending days (both high and low).\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Modified email list privileges\nContent:\nVerified users ( [how to verify your email](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-ui) ) may also sign-up for email notifications to be alerted when an anomaly is detected.

While Snowflake’s per-second billing offers flexibility, it also means a single efficient query can eat through hundreds of dollars – which is why manual warehouse management can’t keep pace with enterprise-sized workloads.\nThe bright side: modern Snowflake FinOps fixes this with automated systems that allow you to optimize spend and performance in real time.\nHow do you get to that point? Read on. We’ll share all of our FinOps best practices,e automation strategies, and real-world tactics that have helped enterprises cut monthly Snowflake costs by 30% or more.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > : Proactive Budget Management and Alerts\nContent:\n**The problem:** Reactive alerts document overspend after it happens.
