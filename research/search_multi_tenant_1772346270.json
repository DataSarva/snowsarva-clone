Although this approach allocates individual objects to tenants, the\napplication still operates within a single Snowflake account.\n●\n**Account Per Tenant (APT):** APT isolates tenants into separate Snowflake accounts. Unlike\nOPT, each tenant within the application has its own dedicated Snowflake account.\nTenancy models have different advantages regarding security, storage, compute, and connectivity,\nand a hybrid approach may be needed to properly address these considerations. Hybrids between\ntenancy models are common. For example, a design might use a multi-tenant table to consolidate\nstorage but allocate dedicated compute resources to each tenant, thereby forming an MTT/OPT\nhybrid design.\nThis white paper has three parts:\n●\nPart One helps data application builders understand the pros-and-cons and\ncosts-and-benefits of the various patterns\n●\nPart Two describes each pattern in greater detail and offers guidance on the Snowflake\nfeatures required for proper implementation\n●\nPart Three provides additional information to help you evaluate tenancy models based on\nsecurity, storage, and compute requirements\n**Part One: Comparing Multi-Tenant**\n**Design Patterns**\nThis section compares and contrasts the three patterns and describes the requirements that tend\nto favor one design approach over the others.\nMulti-tenant table (MTT)\nMTT's chief characteristics are **scalability** and **architectural simplicity** .\n●\nMTT is the most scalable design pattern in terms of the number of tenants an application\ncan support. This approach supports apps with millions of tenants.\nPage 2\n●\nIt has a simpler architecture within Snowflake. Simplicity matters because object\nproliferation makes managing myriad objects increasingly difficult over time. With MTT,\nadding tenants does not cause the number of objects to grow, but adding tenants to OPT\nand APT can result in hundreds or thousands of objects being created within Snowflake.\nFrom a cost standpoint, MTT is usually more cost-efficient because multiple customers utilize\nshared compute and other resources more efficiently.\nBut MTT has a somewhat rigid requirement: To use MTT, an app's data model has to have the same\ngeneral shape across all tenants. Application builders can achieve slight variances using custom\n ... \ndedicated warehouses based on application requirements\n●\nUse different warehouses for different application purposes\n●\nIsolate other workloads to their own warehouses\nWhen it comes to tenants, app builders need to make decisions around whether to give tenants a\ndedicated warehouse, versus pooling them on common warehouses or multi-cluster warehouses.\nCost will be a factor. You can pool dashboard queries more easily than ad hoc queries because\nthey're predictable. Ad hoc usage can introduce unexpected and unplanned expenses. Strict COGS\nper tenant calculations are a reason to separate tenants into dedicated warehouses because\npooled heuristics are less precise. Some applications pool users by default but offer the option to\npay extra to get a dedicated warehouse.\nPage 14\nFigure 9: Separating workloads based on the type of workload is a best practice.\n**Routing users to warehouses**\nTo make application management easier, it's essential to configure RBAC and default warehouses"]},{"url":"https://medium.com/@marya.gautam/single-vs-multi-tenancy-in-snowflake-a-practical-breakdown-for-data-architects-f3f99ee3f983","title":"🧊 Single vs. Multi-Tenancy in Snowflake: A Practical Breakdown for Data Architects | by Gautam Marya | Medium","publish_date":"2025-04-20","excerpts":["Sitemap\n[Open in app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medium.reader&referrer=utm_source%3DmobileNavBar&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\nGet app\nWrite\nSearch\nSection Title: 🧊 Single vs. Multi-Tenancy in Snowflake: A Practical Breakdown for Data Architects\nContent:\nGautam Marya\n5 min read\n·\nApr 20, 2025\n--\nListen\nShare\nSection Title: 🧊 Single vs. Multi-Tenancy in Snowflake: A Practical Breakdown for Data Architects > Contents\nContent:\n∘ 🔍 What Does “Tenancy” Mean in Snowflake?\n∘ 🧱 Single-Tenant Vs Multi-Tenant Comparison\n∘ 🔐 Security & Compliance Considerations\n∘ ⚙️ Performance & Cost: What to Expect\n∘ 💵 Billing Implications\n∘ 🧭 Decision Guide: Which One Should You Choose?\n∘ 🧾 Final Thoughts\n*“Should I go single-tenant or multi-tenant in Snowflake?”* If you’ve asked this question before — or had a strong opinion on it — this article is for you.\nSnowflake’s flexible architecture is one of the platform’s biggest strengths, but with great flexibility comes decision fatigue. One key design choice that data teams often grapple with early on is whether to go with a **single-tenant** or **multi-tenant** account strategy.\nThis article unpacks both approaches in the context of Snowflake, their trade-offs, use cases, and what you should consider when making your choice.\nSection Title: ... > 🔍 What Does “Tenancy” Mean in Snowflake?\nContent:\nLet’s start with a quick refresher:\nSection Title: ... > 🔍 What Does “Tenancy” Mean in Snowflake?\nContent:\n**Single-tenancy** : In this model, each individual customer, specific business unit, or unique use case is allocated its own dedicated and **isolated Snowflake account** . This approach ensures that the data and resources of one customer remain completely separate from those of others, providing enhanced security and tailored performance for each user’s needs. By utilizing single-tenancy, organizations can have greater control over their data environment, facilitating customized configurations and optimizations that align with their specific operational requirements. **Multi-tenancy** refers to a robust architectural approach where multiple tenants, or users, can share a **single Snowflake account** . This design not only enhances resource efficiency but also provides a seamless experience for users. Within this framework, there is a logical separation of data and access through the use of roles, databases, and schemas.\nSection Title: ... > 🔍 What Does “Tenancy” Mean in Snowflake?\nContent:\nEach tenant can operate independently while still benefiting from the shared infrastructure, ensuring that their data remains secure and isolated from others. This model is particularly advantageous for organizations looking to optimize their resources while maintaining strict data governance and security protocols.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > ⚙️ Performance & Cost: What to Expect\nContent:\nThe architecture is designed to provide each account with its own dedicated virtual warehouses. This means that resources are allocated specifically for each individual account, ensuring that performance is optimized and tailored to the needs of that particular tenant. One of the significant advantages of this model is the elimination of the risk associated with “noisy neighbors,” which refers to the potential performance degradation that can occur when multiple tenants share the same resources. In a single-tenant environment, each account operates independently, thus avoiding any interference from other tenants’ activities. It is important to consider some potential downsides of this model. For instance, if the tenants utilizing the system are small or if their usage patterns are uneven, there is a possibility that you might end up paying for idle compute resources.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 🧾 Final Thoughts\nContent:\nChoosing between **single-tenancy** and **multi-tenancy** in Snowflake isn’t just a technical decision — it’s a strategic one that touches architecture, governance, security, cost, and user experience. There’s no universal right answer, and often, the best solution lies in **hybrid models** that evolve with your platform’s maturity and customer needs.\nThe key is understanding your **business context** , **compliance requirements** , and **operational capabilities** — then designing for clarity, control, and scale.\nWhether you’re architecting a multi-tenant SaaS platform or segmenting business units within an enterprise, Snowflake gives you the flexibility to do both — **just make sure you have the governance to match the power** .\nThanks for reading!

As you may have guessed, it’s no surprise that the client saw Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse as a major enabler of this kind of architecture.\nSnowflake has a rich ecosystem of 3rd party data integration technologies and native features such as Snowpipe to integrate data. Additionally, if the data cannot be brought in for compliance reasons, Snowflake can integrate with external data lakes.\nSnowflake governance and security model is based on both Role Based Access Control and Discretionary Access control principles. It allows for a flexible governance framework within Snowflake accounts. However, you can scale your Access Control model across multiple snowflake accounts in a federated model.\nSection Title: ... > After some consultation and discovery, it was clear we needed to focus on:\nContent:\nSnowflake native separation of storage and compute and cost control mechanisms allow dedicated computing for workloads and the ability to track those compute and storage costs granularly.\nSnowflake data-sharing features allow different accounts to securely share data without physically moving the data. This will enable data to stay federated yet accessible for querying with proper governance and security controls.\nUnderstanding your technical, business, and compliance requirements is key to designing a successful multi-tenant architecture. Luckily, Snowflake has many features necessary to develop it securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.\nLet’s look at Snowflake’s recommended architectural patterns, best practices, and suggestions for designing your own Snowflake Multi-Tenant data warehouse solution.\nSection Title: ... > After some consultation and discovery, it was clear we needed to focus on:\nContent:\nDisclaimer: This article refers to Snowflake’s May 2021 publication “Design Patterns for Building Multi-Tenant Applications on Snowflake.” The original version is available at the following [link](https://developers.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Design-Patterns-for-Building-Multi-Tenant-Applications-on-Snowflake.pdf) .\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Pros\nContent:\nOPT is an ideal solution when each tenant has a unique data model.\nSome customers prefer the OPT model to avoid managing entitlement tables, secure views, or row-level security requiring solid processes.\nThe OPT design pattern considers security as a critical factor. Some apps utilizing the OPT model provide customers with dedicated computing resources to meet contractual, security, or regulatory requirements.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Best practices\nContent:\nIt is common practice to separate customers into their databases as it provides the most straightforward and cleanest isolation level. However, some app builders choose to separate customers into dedicated tables, for instance, in embedded analytics use cases where data applications create a report table per tenant.\nImplement OPT authentication and authorization similar to MTT. However, it is advisable to implement a user lookup process within the secrets manager and application tier to route the user to the proper database automatically and the correct warehouse.\nTenant data can be ingested and transformed through a single working database and then distributed to tenant-serving databases to optimize efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, Keeping the same tenant-per-database separation at this level is also possible."]},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/security-overview","title":"Security requirements and guidelines for a Snowflake Native App | Snowflake Documentation","excerpts":["Developer Snowflake Native App Framework Security requirements and guidelines\nSection Title: Security requirements and guidelines for a Snowflake Native App ¶\nContent:\nFeature — Generally Available\nThe Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms.

However, that flexibility comes with a key architectural choice: **how do you isolate tenants?**\nSnowflake offers three broad design patterns:\n**Account per Tenant** (single Snowflake account per tenant)\n**Object per Tenant** (schemas, databases, warehouses inside a shared account)\n**Multi-Tenant Tables** (shared tables with row-level separation)\nEach model has trade-offs in **management complexity, cost, and security** , and the right choice often depends on how you run pipelines, deploy dbt or transformation projects, manage cloud integrations, and enforce governance.\nSection Title: Multi-Tenant Design Patterns on Snowflake > ... > The Models in Detail > 1. Account per Tenant\nContent:\n**Strongest isolation** but also the most expensive and operationally heavy.\nEach account can have its own Snowflake account, dbt repo, CI/CD pipeline, and cloud integrations.\nBest suited for regulated industries, high-sensitivity clients, or consulting engagements where clear boundaries are required.\n ... \nSection Title: Multi-Tenant Design Patterns on Snowflake > ... > Beyond the Models: Collaboration & Operational Fit\nContent:\nChoosing a pattern isn’t just about cost or security—it’s also about **how people collaborate** on data infrastructure.\nFor example:\nIn an **Object per Tenant** model, you may want to provide external access to a dbt or a Terraform repository. Sharing one central repo often isn’t practical, so you end up spinning up **multiple repos** to isolate access. That increases repo sprawl and CI/CD complexity.\nIn an **Account per Tenant** model, repo isolation comes naturally, but now you’re duplicating a lot of infrastructure.\nIn a **Multi-Tenant Table** model, collaboration is centralized, but you can’t easily let tenants contribute directly without exposing all logic.\n‍\nThe lesson: **Your multi-tenant strategy is also a collaboration strategy.** Decisions about Snowflake isolation ripple into repo structures, CI/CD design, and who owns which part of the stack.\nSection Title: Multi-Tenant Design Patterns on Snowflake > ... > Hybrid Approaches: The Real-World Default\nContent:\nIn practice, most organizations don’t pick just one pattern—they blend them. Examples:\n**Object per Tenant for Snowflake objects** , but **individual dbt repos per org** so each vertical or client can control transformations independently.\n**Object per Tenant for storage** (separate schemas/databases), but **Multi-Tenant Tables for compute** so warehouses can be pooled to minimize cost.\n**Multi-Tenant Tables for staging raw data** , but **Account per Tenant for production workloads** when clients require strong SLAs and security (example leveraging a Snowflake Data Share for sharing data).\n‍\nThese hybrid solutions recognize that **no single model is perfect** . Teams often optimize isolation at one layer (security, repos, or cloud integration) while pooling resources at another (compute, storage, orchestration).\nSection Title: Multi-Tenant Design Patterns on Snowflake > ... > Collaboration Questions to Ask\nContent:\nWhen designing your architecture, don’t just ask “Which pattern fits?” Ask:\nDo tenants need repo access (dbt, Terraform etc.) and at what level?\nHow much repo isolation can we handle operationally?\nWho owns Snowflake infrastructure vs transformation logic?\nHow will we enforce network policies and cloud storage integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP)?\nWhere do we want to optimize for cost vs security vs maintainability?\nSection Title: Multi-Tenant Design Patterns on Snowflake > ... > The Models in Detail > Choosing the Right Approach\nContent:\n**Account per Tenant** → when compliance, strict security, or large enterprise clients demand isolation.\n**Object per Tenant** → when you want balance: good isolation, manageable repos, and pooled cloud integration.\n**Multi-Tenant Tables** → when you’re optimizing for SaaS scale and cost.\n**Hybrid models** → when you need to blend isolation and efficiency, e.g., object-level separation for governance + shared compute for cost savings.\n‍\nThe decision isn’t just **architecture** . It’s **architecture + collaboration + governance** . Get all three right, and your Snowflake multi-tenant design will scale with your business.\nNeed help in planning or optimizing your setup?
