Many of these providers make their products available on Snowflake Marketplace for Snowflake customers to purchase — and they use our integrated Marketplace Monetization capabilities to simplify the process and speed up procurement and sales cycles. Some even leverage Marketplace Monetization exclusively to avoid having to build, manage or maintain their own billing and payment infrastructure. Let’s take a closer look at Snowflake’s monetization options, how providers can maximize their listing flexibility, and why both providers and their customers benefit from simplifying access to the latest data, services and apps.\n\n#### What is Marketplace Monetization?\n\nMarketplace Monetization allows providers to sell their products to Snowflake customers and invoice them directly through Snowflake. Because they’re purchasing through an already-known vendor, customers can avoid the potentially lengthy process of vetting, onboarding and verifying security policies for a new vendor and start using the data products right away. Shortening the sales, procurement and contracting cycle translates into faster time to value — which is good news for both customers and providers. Customers can also easily pay their Snowflake Marketplace invoice via electronic fund transfer, credit card payment or even with their Snowflake capacity commitment (via Marketplace Capacity Drawdown for eligible customers). The customer’s monetary payment is disbursed directly to the provider. Pricing is, of course, controlled and defined by the provider. It can be custom and privately available/visible for select customers, or be made more general for standardized products that are publicly available. Snowflake offers a multitude of monetization models from pay-as-you-go usage that is based on consumption to all-you-can-eat subscription-based models. No matter which model they use, providers can port their pricing and monetization strategy directly to Snowflake without worrying about pricing strategy mismatch across channels. (Please note: Snowflake currently only supports USD-based pricing for Marketplace Monetization.) Understandably, customers may hesitate to pay for a data product without a chance to “kick the tires” a bit and properly evaluate the solution. Snowflake Marketplace takes care of this with several options to allow customers to try out a listing before purchasing: * Time-limited trials\n* Limited functionality trials, analogous to the “freemium” model common to SaaS products\n* Usage-based trials (currently in private preview)\n Many successful providers publish public paid listings with free trials on Snowflake Marketplace to create awareness with new and existing customers. This strategy allows them to address the self-service customer segments while still generating leads for upselling and creating opportunities for private conversations about customized products. One of the most valuable features of Snowflake’s monetization capabilities, in my opinion, is that Snowflake shares end-to-end analytics back to providers. You get a view of valuable information, including: * How many customers viewed your product listings\n* How many customers started a trial\n* The amount of product usage and which objects in the share are being used\n* Who tried or purchased your product (including contact information) and how much they were charged\n* How much money has been disbursed to your bank\n With this depth of insight, providers can focus their time on the most important parts of their funnel to drive new business and close new sales, but always have the entire customer lifecycle view available. Snowflake offers all of this functionality out of the box to help our providers reduce overhead for products listed on Snowflake Marketplace, but also to speed up the time to value for the consumers who are using their products.\n\n#### What monetization models are available?\n\nThere are two monetization models available: usage-based and subscription. Our **usage-based pricing model** allows providers to lower barriers to entry for consumers (also one of the reasons why Snowflake employs usage-based pricing). They can start using your products and get value immediately, without committing to long-term contracts. Examples here include pricing per query or per month when usage occurs. Snowflake Native Apps also have an exclusive usage-based pricing model: custom event billing (currently in public preview). This API-based billing allows providers to charge and meter based on nearly any value their app offers. For example, you can specify billing events in your app code and charge consumers based entirely on their usage of your application. This is a flexible, usage-based pricing model to allow providers to price-to-value their applications. Common examples include: * Price by the number of rows/bytes ingested or number of output rows by the application, such as data clean rooms and applications that enrich data\n* Price by number of monthly active rows ingested by the application, such as ETL and reverse ETL\n* Price by number of unique users using the application\n As the consumer expands their use of and gets more value from the data product or app, providers may want to implement a **subscription-based pricing model** to give these customers more predictable pricing. Snowflake offers recurring and non-recurring subscription models — with term duration ranging from a single month to many months to multiple years — with a pay up front for access or pay later option. Subscription payments can be made even more flexible with the option to pay via installments over the duration of the term. You can configure the subscription to allow portions of the payment to be front-loaded, back-loaded or spread evenly throughout the subscription term depending on the customer’s preferences and the provider’s needs. And, of course, all of the backend processes are handled by Snowflake Marketplace Monetization without additional overhead for the provider.\n\n#### Learn more about monetizing data products and services on Snowflake Marketplace\n\nThe Snowflake platform offers built-in capabilities that simplify the process of turning your data and apps into fully monetized, revenue-generating assets.

Chaos Genius has been [acquired by Flexera](https://www.flexera.com/more/ProsperOps-Chaos-Genius) .\n\nBuilding and deploying [data applications](https://www.snowflake.com/guides/applications/) often comes with unnecessary complexity. Snowflake has significantly reduced this by introducing **Snowflake Native Apps** . Snowflake Native Apps allow you to build, run and monetize data apps directly within the Snowflake ecosystem. No external integrations. No infrastructure headaches. Snowflake previously supported [Connected Apps](https://www.snowflake.com/guides/connected-apps) , which operated outside Snowflake, connected via [APIs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/api-reference) and required manual data movement. Native Apps, by contrast, run entirely within Snowflake, leveraging its secure and scalable infrastructure . They’re built using the _Snowflake Native App Framework_ , allowing you to develop secure, scalable and integrated Snowflake apps that leverage Snowflake’s environment without leaving the Snowflake platform.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the features, benefits and inner workings of Snowflake Native Apps and walk you through the step-by-step process of creating a Snowflake Native App and publishing and monetizing your Native Apps through the Snowflake Marketplace.\n\n## What Are Snowflake Native Applications?\n\n**Snowflake Native Apps** are applications built using the Snowflake Native App Framework, which allows developers to create, test and deploy applications directly within Snowflake’s Data Cloud. These Native Apps leverage Snowflake’s core features like stored procedures , user-defined functions (Snowflake UDFs) and the [Snowpark API](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index) , all while keeping the data secure by running the code on your data stored in Snowflake. Native apps are available on the Snowflake Marketplace . You can discover and install them quickly, just like downloading an app on your smartphone.\n\n**TL;DR:  \n** **What They Are** — Snowflake Native Apps run entirely within Snowflake, eliminating the need to move data out for processing.  \n**How They Work** — Snowflake Native Apps operate in your Snowflake account, using your existing data without external connections. Developers create and distribute them via the Snowflake Marketplace.  \n**Why Use Them** :\n\n* **Fast** — Snowflake Native Apps process data directly in Snowflake, reducing latency.\n* **Secure** — Snowflake Native Apps don’t access or store data outside your account, relying on Snowflake’s encryption and access controls.\n* **Scalable** — Snowflake Native Apps can grow alongside your Snowflake resources, handling larger datasets or more users.\n\nSnowflake Native Apps (Source: [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/applications/native-apps/) )\n\n### Key Technical Characteristics of Snowflake Native Apps\n\n#### 1) **Native Integration with Snowflake Services**\n\nSnowflake Native Apps work directly with Snowflake’s core services. They use stored procedures , user-defined functions (Snowflake UDFs UDFs) and the Snowpark API, making them efficient and seamless.\n\n#### 2) **Simplified Development and Testing**\n\nYou can build Snowflake Native Applications using the Snowflake Native App Framework. Snowflake Native App Framework streamlines development and testing. You can create, test and deploy Snowflake apps within Snowflake, reducing development time.\n\n#### 3) **Monetization via Snowflake Marketplace**\n\nProviders can list and sell Snowflake apps in the Snowflake Marketplace . Consumers install these apps directly into their Snowflake accounts, simplifying deployment and making app monetization straightforward.\n\n#### 4) **Security and Governance**\n\nSnowflake Native Applications don’t transfer data outside the platform. Providers can package their logic securely, protecting intellectual property. Users maintain control of access permissions, with data security managed by Snowflake’s encryption and governance features .\n\n#### 5) **Data Sharing**\n\nSnowflake Native Apps leverage [Snowflake’s secure data sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro) . Apps can access shared datasets without creating duplicates or requiring data to leave the user’s Snowflake account.\n\n#### 6) **Advanced Feature Support**\n\nSnowflake Native Applications use Snowflake features like:\n\n* User-Defined Functions (Snowflake UDFs)\n* Stored Procedures\n* [Snowpark](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index)\n\n#### 7) **Versioning and Patching**\n\nSnowflake Native App Framework supports versioning and patching, allowing you to manage updates easily. This keeps your apps up to date.\n\n#### 8) **Streamlit Integration**\n\nYou can integrate your apps with Streamlit , which allows you to create interactive dashboards within Snowflake. While the integration is still evolving, it supports embedding visualizations in your apps for end-user analytics.\n\n#### 9) **Encapsulation in Application Packages**\n\nSnowflake Native Apps are bundled into packages containing all necessary components (e.g., data content, application logic, metadata and setup scripts). This makes deployment simple and reduces compatibility issues.\n\n#### 10) **Source Control and Tool Integration**\n\nYou can integrate with external tools like [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) , [CI/CD pipelines](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-cicd-pipeline) and source control systems. This flexibility helps teams adopt DevOps practices when developing Snowflake Native Applications.\n\n#### 11) **AI and ML Workflows**\n\nSnowflake Native Applications support machine learning and AI tasks through Snowpark. You can integrate external ML libraries, process training data and deploy models directly within Snowflake.\n\n#### 12) **Cross-Cloud Deployment (AWS + Azure + with limitations on GCP)**\n\nSnowflake Native Applications are compatible with multiple clouds ( [AWS](https://www.snowflake.com/en/why-snowflake/partners/all-partners/aws/) , [Azure](https://www.snowflake.com/en/why-snowflake/partners/all-partners/microsoft/) and limit on [GCP](https://www.snowflake.com/technology-partners/google-cloud-platform/) ). This feature enables users to run apps across different infrastructures, though GCP support has limitations.\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Snowflake Native Apps — For Providers?\n\nSnowflake Native Apps offer significant advantages for providers looking to build, distribute and monetize their applications within the Snowflake ecosystem. Here are some of the benefits:\n\n### ➥ Simplified Development\n\nProviders can use Snowflake’s tools to build apps that leverage Snowflake’s high availability and scalability. This completely eliminates the need for separate infrastructure, reducing development overhead and speeding up time to market​.\n\nSnowflake Native Apps run within customers’ Snowflake accounts, meaning data stays within their environment, which minimizes the complexity of data integration and security management​.\n\n### ➥ **On-Platform Monetization Opportunities**\n\nProviders can easily sell and monetize their Snowflake apps directly within the Snowflake ecosystem via Snowflake Marketplace , bypassing the need for third-party systems.\n\n### ➥ **Easy Management**\n\nSince apps are hosted within Snowflake’s infrastructure, you don’t need to manage separate resources. Snowflake offers always-on availability, global reach, built-in governance and secure operations.\n\n### ➥ **Data Protection**\n\nSnowflake Native Apps interact directly with the customer’s Snowflake account. This approach keeps customer data within their environment, reducing security risks and compliance burdens. You avoid the complexity of managing sensitive data, as Snowflake’s internal security and governance capability can handle it for you.\n\n### ➥ **Zero Infrastructure Management and Lower Operational Costs**\n\nTraditional Snowflake apps often require providers to pay for their own compute and storage. With Snowflake Native Applications, you leverage the customer’s compute resources, reducing your operating costs and improving profit margins.\n\n### ➥ **Access to New Customers**\n\nSnowflake Marketplace gives you exposure to a global Snowflake customer base. Here, customers can find, test and purchase your apps. This built-in distribution network simplifies how you reach and onboard users while enabling seamless deployment directly into customer environments.\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Snowflake Native Apps — For Consumers?\n\nSnowflake Native Apps offer significant advantages for end-users, enhancing their ability to integrate, utilize and manage data applications seamlessly within the Snowflake ecosystem.

This eliminates the risks associated with data transfers and ensures compliance with Snowflake’s robust governance and security controls.\n\n### ➥ **Enhanced Performance**\n\nSnowflake Native apps utilize the consumer’s Snowflake compute resources, which ensures optimal performance tailored to the existing workload. Consumers benefit from Snowflake’s underlying scalability and processing power, resulting in faster query execution and application responsiveness​.\n\n### ➥ **Streamlined Trial and Deployment**\n\nConsumers can easily test applications via trial periods. Transitioning from trial to full versions is simple and data generated during the trial is retained for future use, making the adoption process seamless and risk-free.\n\n### ➥ **Simplified Application Management**\n\nConsumers can manage access privileges, event logging and app-related tasks directly within their Snowflake account.\n\n## How Do Snowflake Native Applications Work?\n\nSnowflake Native Applications leverage the _Snowflake Native App Framework_ to build and deploy data-driven applications directly within the Snowflake ecosystem. These Snowflake apps harness Snowflake’s core features—secure data sharing, analytics, compute and governance—enabling seamless integration and monetization, without requiring data to move outside the platform. The framework supports applications ranging from analytical tools to fully containerized services.\n\nSnowflake Native App Framework allows:\n\n* Providers to share data, business logic and application interfaces (e.g., Streamlit apps, stored procedures) using [Snowpark API](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index) , [Python](https://www.python.org/) , [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) .\n* Applications to be listed as free or paid offerings on the Snowflake Marketplace or shared privately with select accounts.\n* Developers to benefit from streamlined testing environments, version control via external repositories and detailed logging for troubleshooting.\n* Built-in support for structured and unstructured event logging to streamline troubleshooting and performance tracking.\n* Integration with Streamlit to build interactive, user-friendly visual interfaces.\n\nOn top of that, the Snowflake Native Framework also provides an enhanced developer experience, including:\n\n* A unified testing environment for app lifecycle management.\n* Integration with version control systems for seamless code and resource management.\n* Incremental app updates with versioning and patch support.\n\nSnowflake Native Apps extend the functionality of features like Secure Data Sharing and Collaboration, ensuring providers can offer scalable, governed applications to other Snowflake users.\n\n### Architecture of the Snowflake Native App Framework\n\nThe architecture of the Snowflake Native App Framework operates on a provider-consumer model:\n\n* **Provider** — Creates and shares data and application logic using the framework.\n* **Consumer** — Installs and interacts with applications shared by providers.\n\nSnowflake Native Applications are packaged as **Application Packages** , which contains the necessary logic, metadata and configuration to deploy a Snowflake Native App. This includes:\n\n* **Manifest file** : Configuration details, including setup script locations and versioning.\n* **Setup script** : Contains SQL commands for installation and updates.\n\nThe provider publishes the Snowflake Native app via:\n\n* **Marketplace Listings** — Accessible to all Snowflake users for broad distribution.\n* **Private Listings** — Targeted sharing with specific accounts across regions.\n\nUpon installation, Snowflake creates a corresponding database object for the app, which runs the setup script to establish necessary resources in the consumer’s account. Additional configurations like logging or privilege grants can be applied post-installation.\n\nSnowflake Native App Architecture\n\n### How do Snowflake Native Applications work with Snowpark Container Services?\n\nFor advanced use cases, Snowflake Native Applications can utilize [**Snowpark Container Services**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) , which enable Snowflake apps to manage containerized workloads within Snowflake. This approach supports high-performance applications, such as machine learning and AI-driven analytics, without externalizing data.\n\nComponents unique to containerized Snowflake apps:\n\n* **Services specification file** — Applications reference container images stored in the provider’s repository.\n* **Compute pool** — A collection of virtual machine nodes where containerized workloads execute.\n\nSnowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Architecture\n\nFeatures of Snowpark Container Services include:\n\n* Support for AI/ML workloads with low latency.\n* Persistent data and model storage close to compute resources for efficiency.\n* Seamless deployment across GPU/CPU configurations.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Snowflake Native App\n\nNow that we have covered the features, benefits and inner workings/architecture of Snowflake Native Applications, let’s dive into a step-by-step guide on how you can create a simple Snowflake Native App on Snowflake.\n\nBefore you start building a Snowflake Native App, make sure you meet these requirements:\n\n## Prerequisite:\n\n* **Snowflake CLI** : Install the Snowflake CLI on your machine.\n* [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : If you haven’t already installed VSCode, download it from here.\n* **ACCOUNTADMIN Role** : Use the ACCOUNTADMIN role for all steps in this tutorial.\n* **Second Snowflake Account** : If installing your app from a private listing, you need access to a second Snowflake account.\n* **Set a Current Warehouse** : Use the USE WAREHOUSE command to specify the active warehouse.\n* **SQL Command Session** : Run all SQL commands within the same session. The session context must remain consistent as the steps build on one another.\n\nLet’s kick off by covering the main pieces you’ll be working with.\n\n**Application Package**\n\nThink of this as a container for your entire application. It holds:\n\n* Shared data\n* Application logic\n* Deployment artifacts\n\n**Setup Script**\n\nThe blueprint of your application’s initialization. This script:\n\n* Creates schemas\n* Sets up application roles\n* Defines initial objects and permissions\n\n**Manifest File**\n\nYour app’s configuration metadata. It tells Snowflake:\n\n* Which files to include\n* How to structure the deployment\n* Runtime behaviors\n\n**Project Definition File**\n\nDefines deployment specifics:\n\n* Application package name\n* Stages\n* Artifacts to include\n\n### **Step 1** —Configuring the Environment\n\n```\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS my_app_db;\nUSE DATABASE my_app_db;\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS my_app_schema;\n```\n\nThis sets up a dedicated space for your app’s data and logic.\n\nNow make sure you have an active warehouse set for executing your SQL commands. You can create a new warehouse or use an existing one:\n\n```\nCREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS <warehouse> WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL';\nUSE WAREHOUSE <warehouse>;\n```\n\n### **Step 2** —Setting Up Snowflake CLI\n\nTo get started, you need to install and configure Snowflake CLI. It allows users to execute SQL queries and carry out a wide range of DDL and DML operations.\n\nTo download Snowflake CLI, first download from the [SnowSQL download page](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/downloads/snowsql/) and then open a new terminal window. Execute the following code to test your connection:\n\n```\nsnow connection add\n```\n\nOnce you have done that, enter all the credentials when prompted.\n\nAdding Snowflake CLI credentials\n\nThat’s it!\n\n> For detailed instructions on installing Snowflake CLI, [refer to the official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/installation/installation) .\n> \n> \n\n### **Step 3** —Initializing a New Project\n\nNow that your environment is set up, you will initialize a new project folder for your app using the Snowflake CLI. Open your terminal and execute:\n\n```\nsnow init --template app_basic snowflake_native_app_demo\n```\n\nInitializing Snowflake Native App project\n\nThis command creates a directory named **snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_demo** , which contains a basic structure for your Snowflake Native App project.\n\nFolder structure of Demo Snowflake Native App\n\nHere’s what is inside the app directory:\n\nFolder structure of Demo Snowflake Native App\n\n**OR**\n\nYou can clone the starter project which is provided by Snowflake by running the following command:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-native-apps.git\n```\n\nCloning Starter Snowflake Native App project\n\n### **Step 4** —Creating Application Files\n\nNavigate to the **snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_demo** directory and create several essential files:\n\n**➥ Configuring Setup Script**\n\nThis SQL script runs automatically when a consumer installs your app. Modify **app/setup\\_script.sql** with the following content (add comment for now, we will update the script later on):\n\n```\n-- Snowflake Native App Setup script\n```\n\n**➥ Configuring Manifest File**\n\nThis YAML file contains configuration information about your app. Create/Update **app/manifest.yml** with this:\n\n**➥ Configuring Project Definition File**\n\nThis YAML file defines objects that can be deployed to Snowflake. Create/Update **snowflake.yml** in the root of your project with this:\n\n```\ndefinition_version: 2\nentities:\n\t\tsnowflake_native_app_demo_package:\n\t\t\ttype: application package\n\t\t\t stage: stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\n\t\t\t manifest: app/manifest.yml\n\t\t\t identifier: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\tartifacts:\n\t\t\t\t - src: app/*\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdest: ./\n\t demo_snowflake_native_app:\n\t\t\t type: application\n\t\t\tfrom:\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\t debug: false\n```\n\nThis file is central to setting up a Snowflake Native App. It specifies key details about the app’s configuration and how resources are managed within Snowflake.\n\nTo create an application package, you need the [CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-application-package) privilege. If your role doesn’t have this, you can grant it with the Snowflake CLI:\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"GRANT CREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE accountadmin\" -c <connection_name>\n```\n\nGranting Create Application Package to account admin\n\n> Replace **connection\\_name** with the connection name specified in your **config.toml** file.\n> \n> \n\n**snowflake.yml** file defines objects and configuration details. Here’s what it includes:\n\n**a) Application Package**\n\nServes as the container for app-related objects. Example: snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_demo\\_package\n\n**b) Application Object**\n\nCreated from the application package. Example: **demo\\_snowflake\\_native\\_app**\n\n**c) Named Stage**\n\nHolds application files. Example: **stage\\_content.hello\\_snowflake\\_stage** . The stage name is schema-qualified and created inside the application package.\n\nIt stores files for setup scripts or runtime use.\n\n**Artifacts Section**\n\nSpecifies file rules for deployment. Example: Files in app/ are uploaded to the root of the stage.\n\nExample mappings:\n\n```\ntutorial/app/manifest.yml → @snowflake_native_app_demo_package.stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\ntutorial/app/README.md → @snowflake_native_app_demo_package.stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\ntutorial/app/setup_script.sql → @snowflake_native_app_demo_package.stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\n```\n\n> Use <% … %> syntax for dynamic referencing. Example: <% ctx.entities.pkg.identifier %> accesses the package identifier.\n> \n> \n\n**Debug Mode**\n\nThe debug field in **snowflake.yml** is set to **false** for production. Debug mode is typically enabled by default during development.\n\n**➥ Configuring README File**\n\nThis file provides a description of your application. Create **app/README.md** with a brief description:\n\n```\nThis is a demo Snowflake Native App.\n```\n\n### **Step 5** —Writing the Snowflake Native Application Logic\n\nNow let’s get to the essence of Snowflake Native App development—adding application logic and installing your first app. This involves creating stored procedures, setting up application roles and configuring privileges for seamless execution. Here’s how you can achieve this:\n\n**➥ Add a Stored Procedure to the Setup Script**\n\nThe setup script is central to your app’s functionality. By extending it, you can define key components like roles and stored procedures.\n\nFirst let’s define an Application Role. To do so, add the following to your **setup\\_script.sql** file:\n\n```\nCREATE APPLICATION ROLE IF NOT EXISTS snowflake_native_app_public;\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS native_app_core;\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA native_app_core TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nAs you can see, this creates an application-specific role ( _snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_public_ ) and a schema (native\\_app\\_core) for the app. And the role is restricted to the app’s context and manages access to app-specific objects.\n\nNext, add a stored procedure that your app can call:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE native_app_core.HELLO()\n\tRETURNS STRING\n\tLANGUAGE SQL\n\tEXECUTE AS OWNER\n\tAS\nBEGIN\n\t RETURN 'Demo Snowflake Native App!';\nEND;\n```\n\nThis stored procedure outputs a simple greeting—useful as a test or base for more complex logic.\n\nFinally, grant the application role permission to use the procedure:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON PROCEDURE native_app_core.hello() TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nNow this role can access and execute the stored procedure.\n\nHere is how your **setup\\_script.sql** file should look like:\n\nWriting the Snowflake Native Application Logic\n\nOnce your setup script includes the necessary logic, install the app in stage dev mode using the Snowflake CLI. Dev mode lets you test app behavior before deploying it to production.\n\nTo test it, run the following Snowflake CLI command:\n\n```\nsnow app run -c connection_name\n```\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\nAs you can see, if the command runs successfully, it outputs a URL where you can see your app in Snowsight.\n\nChecking a Deployed Snowflake Native App in Snowsight\n\nTo run the stored procedure that you added to **setup\\_script.sql** in a previous section, run the following Snowflake CLI command:\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"call demo_snowflake_native_app.native_app_core.hello()\" -c connection_name\n```\n\nYou should see the following result/output:\n\nRunning deployed Stored procedure via Snowflake CLI\n\n### **Step 6** —Adding Data Content to Your Snowflake Native App\n\nIn this step, you’ll enhance your Snowflake Native App by incorporating shared data content. This involves creating and sharing a table within your app package and granting access to app users. Additionally, you’ll create a view for secure data access by consumers.\n\nFirst, let’s create a table to share with the app. To do so, you can add a table to your app package by writing a SQL script and specifying its execution in the project definition file.\n\nSo let’s create and populate the table. To do that, you need to create a folder **scripts** and inside that folder, create a file called **shared\\_content.sql** . Then, add the following code:\n\n```\nUSE APPLICATION PACKAGE <% ctx.entities.snowflake_native_app_demo_package.identifier %>;\n\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS shared_data;\nUSE SCHEMA shared_data;\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wealthy_individuals (\n\t\tid INT,\n\t\t name VARCHAR,\n\t\tstatus VARCHAR\n);\n\nTRUNCATE TABLE wealthy_individuals;\n\nINSERT INTO wealthy_individuals VALUES\n\t\t (1, 'Elon', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(2, 'Bernard', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(3, 'Jeff', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t (4, 'Warren', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(5, 'Larry', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(6, 'Sergey', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t (7, 'Gautam', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(8, 'Carlos', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t (9, 'Mukesh', 'Billionaire'),\n\t\t(10, 'Bill', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t(11, 'Mark', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t(12, 'Larry', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t (13, 'Michael', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t(14, 'Aman', 'Millionaire'),\n\t\t(15, 'Warren', 'Billionaire');\n```\n\nNow, grant access to the table and schema using:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA shared_data TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE <% ctx.entities.snowflake_native_app_demo_package.identifier %>;\nGRANT SELECT ON TABLE wealthy_individuals TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE <% ctx.entities.snowflake_native_app_demo_package.identifier %>;\n```\n\nThe placeholder `<% ctx.entities.snowflake_native_app_demo_package.identifier %>` dynamically resolves to your application package identifier during deployment.\n\n**Add the Script to the Project Definition File**\n\nUpdate the **snowflake.yml** file to include the new script in post-deployment hooks:\n\n```\ndefinition_version: 2\nentities:\n\t snowflake_native_app_demo_package:\n\t\t\t type: application package\n\t\t\tstage: stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\n\t\t\tmanifest: app/manifest.yml\n\t\t\tidentifier: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\t artifacts:\n\t\t\t\t\t- src: app/*\n\t\t\t\t\t dest: ./\n\t\t\t meta:\n\t\t\t\t post_deploy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t - sql_script: scripts/shared_content.sql\n\t\tdemo_snowflake_native_app:\n\t\t\ttype: application\n\t\t\t from:\n\t\t\t\t target: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\tdebug: false\n```\n\nNext, modify the **setup\\_script.sql** file to create a view that app consumers can use to query the data.\n\n**Create a Versioned Schema:**\n\n```\nCREATE OR ALTER VERSIONED SCHEMA code_schema;\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA code_schema TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\n**Create the View:**\n\n```\nCREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS code_schema.accounts_view\n\t AS SELECT roll_number, NAME, VALUE\n\t FROM shared_data.wealthy_individuals;\nGRANT SELECT ON VIEW code_schema.accounts_view TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nAfter adding the table and view, test the updated app to make sure everything works as expected. Let’s deploy the updates:\n\n```\nsnow app run -c connection_name\n```\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\nThis uploads the edited files to the stage, runs **scripts/shared\\_content.sql** and deploys the app.\n\nNow, finally to verify the data access, fire the command below:\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"SELECT * FROM demo_snowflake_native_app.code_schema.accounts_view\" -c connection_name\n```\n\nVerifying Snowflake data access\n\nThe output should list the sample data from the accounts table.\n\n### **Step 7** —Adding Python Code to Your Snowflake Native App\n\nLet’s enhance our Snowflake Native App by incorporating Python-based logic using User-Defined Functions (Snowflake UDFs). We’ll add both an inline Python UDF and one that references an external Python module.\n\nInline Python UDFs enable you to embed Python logic directly within your setup script. To do so, update your setup script to include the following code:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION code_schema.squareroot(i INT)\nRETURNS INT\nLANGUAGE PYTHON\nRUNTIME_VERSION = '3.11'\nHANDLER = 'squareroot_py'\nAS\n$$\ndef squareroot_py(i):\n\t return i * i\n$$;\n\nGRANT USAGE ON FUNCTION code_schema.squareroot(INT) TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nAs you can see, this:\n\n* Creates a Python UDF named squareroot in the code\\_schema schema.\n* Uses Python 3.11 runtime.\n* Grants the necessary usage privilege to the snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_public role.\n\nNow let’s reference a Python file for modular and reusable logic. First, let’s add this code to your setup script:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION code_schema.cuberoot(i INT)\nRETURNS FLOAT\nLANGUAGE PYTHON\nRUNTIME_VERSION = 3.11\nIMPORTS = ('/python/cube_python.py')\nHANDLER = 'cube_python.cuberoot';\n\nGRANT USAGE ON FUNCTION code_schema.cuberoot(INT) TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nNow let’s add the external Python file. To do this, in the project folder, create a subdirectory: **python/** . Inside this folder, create a file named **cube\\_python.py** with the following content:\n\n```\ndef cuberoot(i):\n\t return i * i * i\n```\n\nUpdate the project definition file to include the Python file:\n\n```\nartifacts:\n\t- src: python/cube_python.py\n```\n\nAfter adding the Python UDFs, deploy and validate their functionality.\n\n**Deploy the Updates:**\n\n```\nsnow app run -c connection_name\n```\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\nThis uploads the updated files to the stage and deploys the app.\n\n**Test the Inline Python UDF:**\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"SELECT demo_snowflake_native_app.code_schema.squareroot(2)\" -c connection_name\n```\n\nOutput:\n\nTesting the Inline Python UDF – Snowflake Native App\n\n**Test the External Python UDF:**\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"SELECT demo_snowflake_native_app.code_schema.cuberoot(2)\" -c connection_name\n```\n\nOutput:\n\nTesting the External Python UDF – Snowflake Native App\n\n### **Step 8** —Adding a Streamlit App to Your Snowflake Native App\n\nNow, let’s integrate a Streamlit-based user interface into your Snowflake Native App. Streamlit is an open-source framework designed for building interactive data applications, offering features for data visualization and user interaction.\n\nHead over to your project folder and create a subdirectory named **streamlit/** . Inside the streamlit folder, create a file named **streamlit\\_app.py** . Then, add the following Python code to **streamlit\\_app.py** :\n\n```\n# Import python packages\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom snowflake.snowpark import Session\n\nst.title(\"Demo Snowflake Native Application\")\nst.write(\n\t\t\"\"\"Demo of Snowflake Native Application\"\"\")\n\n# Get the current credentials\nsession = Session.builder.getOrCreate()\n\n# Create an example data frame\ndata_frame = session.sql(\"SELECT * FROM code_schema.accounts_view\")\n\n# Execute the query and convert it into a Pandas data frame\nqueried_data = data_frame.to_pandas()\n\n# Display the Pandas data frame as a Streamlit data frame.\nst.dataframe(queried_data, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\nNext, add the following to the artifacts section of the project definition file:\n\n```\nartifacts:\n\t - src: streamlit/streamlit_app.py\n```\n\nThis is how your **snowflake.yml** should look:\n\n```\ndefinition_version: 2\nentities:\n\t\tsnowflake_native_app_demo_package:\n\t\t\ttype: application package\n\t\t\t stage: stage_content.hello_snowflake_stage\n\t\t\t manifest: app/manifest.yml\n\t\t\t identifier: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\tartifacts:\n\t\t\t\t - src: app/*\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdest: ./\n\t\t\t\t - src: python/cube_python.py\n\t\t\t\t\t- src: streamlit/streamlit_app.py\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tmeta:\n\t\t\t\t\tpost_deploy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- sql_script: scripts/shared_content.sql\n\t demo_snowflake_native_app:\n\t\t\t type: application\n\t\t\tfrom:\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget: snowflake_native_app_demo_package\n\t\t\t debug: false\n```\n\nThen, create the Streamlit object. To do that, add the following to the end of the **setup\\_script.sql** file:\n\n```\nCREATE STREAMLIT IF NOT EXISTS code_schema.snowflake_streamlit_native_app\n\tFROM '/streamlit'\n\t MAIN_FILE = '/streamlit_app.py'\n;\n```\n\nAdd the following statement to the same script to allow the application role to access the Streamlit object:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON STREAMLIT code_schema.hello_snowflake_streamlit TO APPLICATION ROLE snowflake_native_app_public;\n```\n\nDeploy the updates by running the following command to update the app:\n\n```\nsnow app run -c connection_name\n```\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\nAfter deployment, a URL will be printed in the console. Navigate to this URL to interact with the app. Click the **snowflake\\_streamlit\\_native\\_app** tab to view the Streamlit interface.\n\nChecking a Deployed Streamlit App in Snowsight\n\n### **Step 9** —Versioning Your Snowflake Native App\n\nLets formalize your Snowflake Native App by creating a version. While previous steps utilized “stage development” mode for rapid iteration, adding a version is essential for listing the application package and sharing it with other Snowflake users.\n\nRun the following command to create version V1 for the **snowflake\\_native\\_app\\_demo\\_package** application package:\n\n```\nsnow app version create v1 -c connection_name\n```\n\nVersioning Snowflake Native App\n\nHere is how you would check the version of the app to see whether it was added successfully or not. To do so, run the following command:\n\n```\nsnow app version list -c connection_name\n```\n\nVersioning Snowflake Native App\n\n### **Step 10** —Installing and Testing the Versioned App\n\nTo install and test the versioned app, run the following command to install the app based on the created version:\n\nDeploying and Running Snowflake Native App via Snowflake CLI\n\n### **Step 11** —Viewing Snowflake Native App in Snowsight\n\nAfter finalizing your Snowflake Native App, you can use Snowsight, Snowflake’s web interface, to explore your app visually, instead of relying solely on SQL commands.\n\nTo start, sign in to Snowsight using your Snowflake credentials. Once logged in, switch to the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role to ensure you have the necessary permissions. You can do this by selecting your username from the navigation menu, opening the account menu and switching from the current active role (e.g., PUBLIC) to **ACCOUNTADMIN** . Next, navigate to the **Data Products** section and select **Apps** from the menu.\n\nNavigating to Data Products > Apps section\n\nLocate your application, **DEMO\\_SNOWFLAKE\\_NATIVE\\_APP** , in the list.\n\nChecking a Deployed Snowflake Native App in Snowsight\n\nClicking on it opens the **Read Me** tab, which displays the content of the **README.md** file you created earlier in this tutorial.\n\nTo view the Streamlit interface, find and select **SNOWFLAKE\\_STREAMLIT\\_NATIVE\\_APP** .\n\nChecking a Deployed Streamlit App in Snowsight\n\n## Monetization and Distribution of Snowflake Native App\n\nNow that we have covered the detailed steps of how you can create and build Snowflake Native Applications from scratch, let’s go through the process of how you can monetize your Snowflake Native Applications via Snowflake Marketplace. But before that, let’s actually understand what Snowflake Marketplace is.\n\nThe Snowflake Marketplace is a platform where users can discover, evaluate and purchase a variety of products, including third-party data, data services, Snowflake Native Apps and AI products. It serves as a public data exchange integrated within the Snowflake Data Cloud, facilitating seamless and secure transactions between data providers and consumers.\n\nThe Snowflake marketplace offers various types of data products, such as:\n\n* Raw datasets\n* Refined and enriched data\n* Historical datasets for forecasting and machine learning\n* Real-time data streams (like weather or traffic updates)\n* Specialized identity or audience data for analytics\n* Snowflake Native Applications\n* Pre-built data pipelines and transformations\n\nSnowflake Marketplace leverages Snowflake’s architecture to facilitate the secure sharing of data and applications. Transactions are managed natively, eliminating the need for third-party billing systems. Vendors can offer their products through various pricing models, such as pay-as-you-go, one-time payment, usage-based payment, or subscription-based plans, while benefiting from Snowflake’s built-in analytics to track customer engagement.\n\nLet’s jump right into the juicy part of the article: a step-by-step guide to monetizing Snowflake Native Applications via Snowflake Marketplace.\n\n### Step-By-Step Monetization Process of a Snowflake Native App via Snowflake Marketplace\n\n#### **Step 1** —Prepare Your Snowflake Native Application Package\n\nBefore monetization, make sure your Snowflake Native App meets Snowflake’s submission requirements:\n\n* The app must be fully functional upon installation, with all necessary resources and configurations included.\n* It must not depend on external systems for core functionality.\n* Should Leverage Snowflake-stored or shared data for operations.\n* Include the following files:\n  \n    + **manifest.yml** (outlines app permissions and dependencies).\n    + **readme.md** (describes app functionality, post-installation setup steps and sample usage SQL).\n    + Setup scripts and external components like Streamlit files or UDF code\n\n#### **Step 2** —Define the Default Release Directive\n\nNow, set the release directive to specify the app version and patch available for distribution:\n\nList available versions and patches:\n\n```\nsnow app version list -c connection_name\n```\n\nThen, set the default release directive:\n\n```\nsnow sql -q \"ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE <your_app_package> SET DEFAULT RELEASE DIRECTIVE VERSION = v1 PATCH = 0\"\n```\n\nVersioning Snowflake Native App\n\nAs you can see, this command sets version **v1** and patch **0** as the default for your app, ensuring it is ready for deployment​.\n\n#### **Step 3** —Create and Configure a Private Listing on the Snowflake Marketplace\n\nTo share your app via the Snowflake Marketplace, start by signing in to Snowsight and navigating to **Data Products > Provider Studio** .\n\nNavigating to Provider Studio in Snowflake\n\nClick **\\+ Listing** to create a new listing and proceed with configuration. Enter a name for the listing and specify the discovery permissions, choosing whether the listing will be public or restricted to specific consumers (e.g., select “ **Only specified consumers** ” for private sharing and select “ **Anyone on the Marketplace** ” for public listing).\n\nCreating a private listing for only specified consumers – Snowflake Native App\n\nAttach the application package you prepared earlier as the core data content for the listing. Provide a detailed description outlining your app’s features and usage scenarios. If creating a private listing, add the account identifiers of intended consumers in the “ **Add** **Consumer accounts** ” section. Finally, publish your listing for approval.\n\nCreating a private listing for only specified consumers – Snowflake Native App\n\n#### **Step 4** —Create and Configure a Public Paid Listing on the Snowflake Marketplace\n\nNow, to create a public listing, you need to first contact your Snowflake business development partner to approve your paid listing. If you don’t have a business development partner, you’ll need to [submit a case with Marketplace Operations](https://snowflakecommunity.force.com/s/provider-onboarding-case) . Before proceeding, verify that your [role has the required privileges to create a listing](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-becoming) .\n\nOnce everything is in place, you need to log in to Snowsight and go to Data Products > Provider Studio from the menu. Select **\\+ Listing** to open the Create Listing window. Here, name your listing and set its visibility. To make the listing publicly discoverable, choose “ **Anyone on the Marketplace** ” under the discovery settings.\n\nCreating a paid private listing for only specified consumers – Snowflake Marketplace\n\nNext, you need to decide how consumers will access your data product: choose “ **Free** ” for no-cost access, “ **Personalized/Limited Trial** ” to offer a trial version with full access upon request, or “ **Paid** ” if you plan to charge consumers directly.\n\nAfter setting the access type, click **Next** to generate a draft listing. Lastly, refine and configure the draft by including all necessary details to ready it for publication on the Snowflake Marketplace.\n\n#### **Step 5** —Submit Listing for Approval\n\nAll listings on the Snowflake Marketplace must undergo a review and approval process before publication. If a listing is rejected, review the provided feedback, make the necessary updates and resubmit it for approval.\n\nBefore publishing make sure that your listing configuration is complete, you have the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role or **OWNERSHIP** privilege for the associated data product and all sample SQL queries in the listing are validated successfully. To submit your listing, sign in to Snowsight, navigate to **Data Products ➤ Provider Studio** , go to the Listings tab, select your draft listing and click **Submit for Approval** .\n\nSubmitting listing for final approval from Snowflake\n\n#### **Step 6** —Final Approval and Publishing\n\nOnce submitted, Snowflake will review your listing and provide an **Approved** or **Denied** status. If denied, review the feedback, make the necessary updates and resubmit the listing. After receiving approval, return to the **Listings** tab, select your approved listing and click **Publish** . Upon publication, the listing will be visible to consumers in all current and future Snowflake Marketplace regions. Regional availability can be managed through cross-cloud auto-fulfillment settings and you can create referral links for direct access to your listing.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Snowflake Native Apps](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/applications/native-apps/)\n* [What Are Native Apps?](https://www.snowflake.com/guides/what-are-native-apps/)\n* [About the Snowflake Native App Framework](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/native-apps-about)\n* [Snowflake Native App Framework on AWS and Azure](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/native-app-framework-available-aws-azure/)\n* [Introducing the Snowflake Native App Framework](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/introducing-snowflake-native-application-framework/)\n* [Getting Started with Snowflake Native Apps](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_native_apps/)\n* [Snowflake Native Apps Example](https://github.com/snowflakedb/native-apps-examples)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnd that’s a wrap!
