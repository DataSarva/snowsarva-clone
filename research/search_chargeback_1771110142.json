Unit economics provides a powerful\nmethodology for normalizing cloud consumption by tying platform costs to\nspecific business or operational drivers. This per-unit approach helps\nyou understand cost efficiency, measure the ROI of your initiatives, and\nmake data-driven decisions about resource allocation and optimization.\nBy translating abstract credit consumption into tangible metrics, you\ncan empower technical and business teams with a shared language for\ndiscussing value and cost. These metrics are commonly tracked across\ntime to show changes in efficiency or business impact.\n**Efficiency metrics (technical KPIs)**\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Cost per customer:** Attributes a portion of the total platform cost\nto each of the company's end customers. This is a powerful metric for\nunderstanding profitability and cost-to-serve at a customer level.\n**Cost per project:** Allocates cloud costs to specific internal\nprojects, products, or initiatives. This enables accurate\nproject-based accounting and helps assess the financial viability of\nnew features or services.\n**\"Bring Your Own Metric\":** Custom define unit economic metrics that\nare unique to your organization's business model. Examples could\ninclude Cost per Transaction, Cost per Shipment, or Cost per Ad\nImpression. Creating these tailored metrics ensures the most accurate\nalignment between cloud spend and core business value.\nIf Snowflake is in the value chain for orders, the cost per order can be a good metric to tie Snowflake consumption to Business Demand Drivers.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Proactively monitor all platform usage\nContent:\nTo establish effective budgets, it's crucial to define [roles and privileges](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) by configuring the role, team, or user responsible for the resources.\nThis ensures that budget tracking aligns with specific business units or\nprojects, enabling accurate cost attribution and accountability. By\nlinking consumption to the relevant stakeholders, you can create a clear\nshowback or chargeback model, which is vital for fostering a sense of\nownership over spending.

This chargeback or showback model is useful for accounting purposes and pinpoints\nareas of the organization that could benefit from controls and optimizations that can reduce costs.\nTo attribute costs to different groups like departments or projects, use the following recommended approach:\nUse object tags to associate resources and users with departments or projects.\nUse query tags to associate individual queries with departments or projects when the queries are\nmade by the same application on behalf of users belonging to multiple departments.\n ... \nSection Title: Attributing cost ¶ > Types of cost attribution scenarios ¶\nContent:\n**Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate\nwarehouses with a department. You can use these object tags to attribute the costs incurred by those warehouses to that\ndepartment entirely. **Resources that are shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of this is a warehouse shared by users from\ndifferent departments. In this case, you use object tags to associate each user with a department. The costs of queries are\nattributed to the users. Using the object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by department. **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\nqueries on behalf of its users.\nSection Title: Attributing cost ¶ > Types of cost attribution scenarios ¶\nContent:\nIn this case, each query executed by the application is assigned a query tag that identifies\nthe team or cost center of the user on whose behalf the query is being made.\n ... \nSection Title: Attributing cost ¶ > Setting up object tags for cost attribution ¶ > Creating the tags ¶\nContent:\nAs part of designing the strategy, decide on the database and schema where you plan to create the tags.\nYou can create a dedicated database and schema for the tags.\nIf you want to tag resources in different accounts across your organization, you can create the tags in a key account in your\norganization (for example, in your organization account ).\nThe following example creates a database named `cost_management` and a schema named `tags` for the tags that you plan to use:\n```\nUSE ROLE tag_admin ; \n\n CREATE DATABASE cost_management ; \n CREATE SCHEMA tags ;\n```\nCopy\nWith `cost_management` and `tags` selected as the current database and schema, create a tag named `cost_center` and set\nthe values allowed for the tag to the names of cost centers:\n```\nCREATE TAG cost_center \n  ALLOWED_VALUES 'finance' , 'marketing' , 'engineering' , 'product' ;\n```\nCopy\n ... \nSection Title: Attributing cost ¶ > Viewing cost by tag in Snowsight ¶\nContent:\nYou can attribute costs by reporting on the use of resources that have the `cost_center` tag.

For example, the AWS CUR is directly ingested from S3 to establish automated, controlled billing data access.

The core unit metrics used are: cost-per and price-per compute credit, stored terabyte, and transferred terabyte. Using these three drivers, we’re able to paint a complete picture of Snowflake’s platform, customer profile, cloud providers, and total business. The diagram below gives a general overview of how we think about these Key Performance Metric levels:\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nUsing this structure, we’re able to quickly understand questions such as:\nSection Title: Snowflake as a FinOps platform > Cloud Performance = Business Performance\nContent:\nWhat changes to customer contracts have most impacted our overall cloud and company margin?\nWhich of our cloud service provider contracts need to be reassessed and when? What impact will that have on specific portions of Snowflake’s business?\nHow are portions of Snowflake’s platform performing in different geographic locations? How should we understand the impact of moving to new cloud regions or Snowflake deployments? What impact will pricing in those areas have on company metric performance in any of the higher-verticals?\nWhich Engineering teams are spending most efficiently? What platform areas contribute the most to cost per credit? How fast are costs in each platform area growing vs. the rest?\nAre our deployments actually earning the forecasted margin?

The unit economics referenced above are used by Snowflake’s accounting for these entries, drawing a straight line through our processes. Product Finance also takes an automated data-driven approach to providing Accounting with monthly flux analyses.\nMaintaining tight and effective controls is critical to running a public company at scale. With all teams aligned on these metrics at such a granular level unlocks these core processes, as well as ways to monitor for anomalous activity.\nSection Title: Snowflake as a FinOps platform > Beyond Standard Anomaly Alerting\nContent:\nIn addition to the above, our platform enables contextual alerting outside of normal, widely-used, cost-focused anomaly alerts. Advanced, actionable anomaly reporting includes notifications around items as varied as Snowflake warehouse sizing and auto-suspension policy violations, long-running server alerts, mismatches among cloud accounts, tax regions, and cost centers, savings plan coverage decreases, etc. We also connect to tools such as Slack to ensure the data is being shared in places where end-users are active. Many of these are currently live, with more being built and refined as needed.\nUtilizing this framework allows for these alerts to be done at varying levels of granularity across the verticals explained above.

Instead, the costs are made visible through regular reporting, allowing each department to see its cloud usage and associated costs. For example, if ClientA’s production unit used $5,000 worth of cloud resources in a month, they would receive a report showing this amount. While they see the cost, it doesn’t directly impact their budget, but it helps them understand their cloud spending.
