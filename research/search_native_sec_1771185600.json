For additional information, see Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions .\n\nThis topic describes the security requirements and best practices that providers must\nfollow when developing a Snowflake Native App. All apps that meet the conditions described in Automated security reviews must conform to the security requirements\noutlined in the following sections:\n\n* Security requirements for application code\n* Security requirements for app functionality\n* Security requirements for app permissions\n\nNote\n\nSecurity requirements are subject to change as Snowflake continues to monitor new potential risks.\n\n## Security requirements for application code ¶\n\nApp code included within an application package must conform to the following security requirements:\n\n1. Your app must not load or execute any code from outside the application package except\n   Snowflake-provided libraries. All the app code, including all library dependencies and setup code,\n   must be included in the app version defined in the application package.\n2. All app code must be un-obfuscated, meaning that the code must be human readable. This requirement\n   includes minified JavaScript code.\n   \n   Note\n   \n   If an app needs to use minified JavaScript code, it must include a corresponding source map file\n   that can be used to recover the un-minified code.\n3. All dependencies or libraries with critical or high common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) must be\n   updated to a secure version, if available.\n\n## Security requirements for app functionality ¶\n\nThe following security requirements apply to the functionality of your app:\n\n1. All apps must provide the following information to customers as part of a listing:\n   \n    1. All app functionality and features.\n    2. All Internet endpoints and URLs that the app connects to.\n    3. All external functions in the app.\n    4. Any consumer data logged, collected, or stored by the app.\n          \n        1. Apps should prohibit all non-essential cookies.\n        2. Apps should communicate all essential cookies to consumers\n2. Apps should function as advertised in the app listing.\n3. All app installation and setup instructions must be included in the app listing.\n4. Apps must not store or require any plain text customer secrets.\n5. Any communication between the app and the Internet should be over an HTTPS connection with a valid\n   TLS certificate.\n6. Apps must not have any functionality that could result in harm to Snowflake, its customers, or third\n   parties. Harm includes but is not limited to:\n   \n    1. Data leakage and/or loss;\n    2. Restricting consumer access to their data unless explicitly designed as part of the app\n          functionality, for example, data masking for data access policies.\n    3. Excessive resource consumption.\n    4. Arbitrary code injection/execution.\n7. All connections to an app, including web-based user interfaces and APIs, must first authenticate using a\n   Snowflake-provided method of authentication. Any app-specific authentication must be presented to users\n   after Snowflake authentication has succeeded.\n8. Apps should not create any public endpoints that allow connections to the app without a successful\n   authentication through Snowflake first.\n\n## Security requirements for app permissions ¶\n\nThe following security requirements apply to the privileges set by your app:\n\n1. All apps must provide the following information in the manifest file:\n   \n    1. All privileges required by the app on all objects.\n    2. All API integrations.\n2. Apps should only ask for the minimum set of privileges needed for the app to function.\n\n## Recommended security best practices ¶\n\nIn addition to the security requirements imposed by the automated security scan, Snowflake recommends the\nfollowing best practices when developing a Snowflake Native App. Following these best practices helps reduce\nthe likelihood of an app being blocked during security review.\n\n* Follow secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices.\n  \n    + Review app code for vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle and fix them before creating\n        an app version.\n    + Review third-party libraries for vulnerabilities and update them to the latest secure version.\n    + Review and update all third-party libraries in the app at least once a quarter.\n* Follow Snowflake security best practices as described in the following:\n  \n    + Security Practices for UDFs and Procedures\n    + Securing an external function\n\n## Recommended security best practices for an app with containers ¶\n\nIn addition to the security best practices for a core Snowflake Native App outlined in Recommended security best practices , the following\nsecurity best practices apply to an app with containers:\n\n* Limit the use of external dependencies and libraries to minimize the attack surface of an app and\n  reduce the risk of supply chain vulnerabilities.\n* Follow container image hardening requirements, such as the use of minimal base images, removal of\n  unnecessary packages, and secure configuration of runtime environments.\n* Use secure communication protocols and encryption for all inter-container and external communication.\n* Generate comprehensive logging and auditing of container activities and data access patterns.\n* Update and patch container images regularly to address known vulnerabilities and security issues.\n* Implement only required privileges to minimizing the attack surface of containerized apps.\n* Managing secrets and sensitive data securely, using appropriate encryption and access controls.\n* Conduct thorough security testing and vulnerability assessments before submitting apps for review.\n* Respond promptly to security incidents and collaborate with Snowflake during incident response.\n* Provide clear and accurate documentation of app functionality, dependencies, and security controls.\n* Educate and guide consumers on the secure use and configuration of their apps.\n\n## Best practices for developing and publishing an application package ¶\n\nTo streamline the development and publishing process for a Snowflake Native App, Snowflake recommends creating\ntwo separate application packages:\n\n* Development application package\n  \n  The development application package is intended for rapid iteration and testing purposes. It should\n  have its DISTRIBUTION property set to `INTERNAL` . This ensures that the application package remains\n  internal and is not distributed to external consumers or to Snowflake scanning and approval.\n  \n  By keeping this package separate from the production package, developers can quickly make changes and\n  test new features without triggering the security review process for each iteration.\n* Production application package\n  \n  The production application package is intended for publishing an application package and distributing it\n  to Snowflake for scanning and approval and to external consumers. The production application package should have\n  its DISTRIBUTION property set to `EXTERNAL` .\n  \n  Only versions that have passed the provider’s security review should be added to this package, ensuring\n  that the app meets the required security standards before being made available to consumers.\n\nBy following the best practice of having separate development and production packages, developers can maintain an efficient\ndevelopment lifecycle while ensuring that only secure and approved versions of the app are published and\ndistributed to external consumers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

For additional information, see Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions .\n\nThis topic provides security guidelines for consumers when running a Snowflake Native App.\n\n## Consumer security best practices ¶\n\nConsumers have a shared responsibility for ensuring the security of their data and the safe\nuse of a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. The following best practices help to ensure the security of an app:\n\n* Review the app’s listing, documentation, and security certification before installing the app.\n* Grant the minimum privileges required for an app.\n* Grant access only to the specific tables and views that the app requires to function correctly.\n* Periodically review and modify the privileges to ensure that the minimum required privileges\n  are granted to the app.\n* Immediately report any suspected security incidents to Snowflake and the app provider.\n* Ensure the secure configuration of the consumer network environment and access controls.\n* Review network controls , network configurations ,\n  and limitations of Snowpark Container Services and ensure only trusted endpoints are accessible to an app.\n* Regularly update and patch systems and software to maintain a secure posture.\n* Educate users on the secure use of apps with containers and the importance of data protection.\n\n## Mitigate data exfiltration risks ¶\n\nDespite the security features of a Snowflake Native App, Snowflake cannot guarantee the security of\na third-party app. Consumers are responsible for ensuring the security of their data.\n\nSnowflake recommends the following policies as part of a comprehensive security program to mitigate\ndata exfiltration and other security risks. This is important when using an app with containers\nprovided by third parties that implement services and ingress.\n\n* Carefully review app listings, documentation, and security certifications before deploying apps.\n* Ensure security controls outlined in Snowflake documentation are appropriate for your use case and\n  environment.\n* Configure app privileges and access controls to use only the minimum privileges required\n  by an app.\n* Regularly review and adjust privileges to maintain this principle and disable unused features.\n* Use a modern, up-to-date browser with security features, for example the latest versions of\n  Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.\n* Ensure that your browser settings are configured to block pop-ups and protect against potential\n  vulnerabilities.\n* Ensure that network rule configurations conform to the expected behavior of the app. When a Snowflake Account URL is\n  added to an external access integration, communication is not limited to a specific account. Traffic can be routed to different\n  accounts based on access methods. Consumers should avoid adding account URLs if possible communication with other Snowflake accounts\n  is unacceptable.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

This requires the consumer to grant the required privileges that allow the app\nto perform these actions. For example, apps must have privileges to perform the following\ntypes of tasks:\n\n* Create and start warehouses and compute pools.\n* Access data in the consumer account.\n* Connect to external endpoints outside of Snowflake.\n\nBy using automated granting of privileges, providers can specify the required privileges in the\nmanifest file of an app. When the consumer installs or upgrades an app, the privileges specified\nin the manifest are automatically granted to the app.\n\nCaution\n\nThe provider must communicate these privileges and their potential impact so that they are\nvisible to the consumer when evaluating and installing the app. After privileges are\nautomatically granted during installation or upgrade, these privileges cannot be revoked.\n\n## Security considerations when using automated granting of privileges ¶\n\nWhen a provider configures an app to use `manifest_version: 2` in the manifest file, automated granting of\nprivileges is enabled. By default this allows Snowflake to automatically\ngrant certain privileges to the app. For information on the privileges\nthat can be automatically granted to the app, see Privileges granted by automated granting of privileges .\n\nDuring installation, Snowsight displays a notification about\nthe privileges requested by the app. When a consumer installs an app\nthat uses automated granting of privileges, they agree that the app may\nbe granted these privileges during upgrades without requiring additional\nconsent.\n\nConsumers can create feature policies that restrict the objects an app\ncan create. For more information on creating feature policies, see Use feature policies to limit the objects an app can create .\n\n## Request privileges for an app using automated granting of privileges ¶\n\nProviders can use automated granting of privileges to specify the privileges an app needs\nto create and use objects in the consumer account. Automated granting of privileges grants the\nrequired privileges to the app when the consumer installs or upgrades the app.\n\n### Set the version of the manifest file ¶\n\nTo enable automated granting of privileges for an app, set the version at the beginning of the\nmanifest file as shown in the following example:\n\n```\nmanifest_version : 2\n```\n\nCopy\n\n### Specify the privileges in the manifest file ¶\n\nTo specify the privileges required by the app, providers must declare them in the manifest file\nof the app.\n\nNote\n\nTo use automated granting of privileges, providers must specify `manifest_version: 2` .\n\nThe following example shows how to specify the CREATE WAREHOUSE privilege in the manifest file:\n\n```\nmanifest_version : 2 \n ... \n privileges : \n - CREATE WAREHOUSE : \n description : \"Allows the app to create warehouses in the consumer account\"\n```\n\nCopy\n\nWhen a consumer installs the app, the CREATE WAREHOUSE privilege is automatically granted to the app.\n\nCaution\n\nIf a provider changes the `manifest_version` property of the manifest file from `2` to `1` ,\nall automatic privileges are revoked from the app during upgrade. If the consumer has explicitly\ngranted privileges to the app, those privileges remain unchanged.\n\nNote\n\nProviders can only change the `manifest_version` property during major upgrades to a new\nversion of the app. The `manifest_version` cannot be changed in a patch release.\n\n### Create the required objects in the setup script ¶\n\nUsing automated granting of privileges, providers can add the SQL commands to the setup script to create and access objects in the consumer account.\n\nThe following example shows how to create a warehouse in the consumer account:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE application_wh ;\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThis command creates a warehouse named `application_wh` in the consumer account. The\nautomated granting of privileges feature allows the app to create the warehouse directly. The\nprovider does not have to add additional logic to check whether the consumer has granted the\nrequired privileges.\n\n## Privileges granted by automated granting of privileges ¶\n\nThe following privileges are supported by automated granting of privileges:\n\n* EXECUTE TASK\n* EXECUTE MANAGED TASK\n* CREATE WAREHOUSE\n* CREATE COMPUTE POOL\n* BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT\n* CREATE DATABASE\n* CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION\n* CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION\n* CREATE SHARE\n* CREATE LISTING\n\nWhen a provider adds these privileges to the manifest file, they are automatically granted to\nthe app during installation and upgrade.\n\n### Restrictions on privileges gated by app specifications ¶\n\nThe following privileges allow apps to create objects, but require additional app specification approval:\n\nCREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION\n    Allows an app to create an external access integration in the consumer account. However, to allow\nconnections to an external endpoint, consumers must also approve the app specification that allows\nthe app to connect to external hosts.\nCREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION\n    Allows an app to create a security integration in the consumer account. However, to enable OAuth\nauthentication, consumers must also approve the app specification that defines the OAuth endpoints\nand scopes.\nCREATE SHARE and CREATE LISTING\n    Allow an app to create shares and listings in the consumer account. However, to share data with\ntarget accounts, consumers must also approve the app specification that specifies the target accounts\nand auto-fulfillment settings.\n\nFor more information about app specifications, see Overview of app specifications .\n\n### Privileges not granted by automated granting of privileges ¶\n\nSome privileges are not automatically granted to the app. Consumers must manually grant these\nprivileges when installing or upgrading an app. For example, the following privileges aren’t automatically granted to the app:\n\n* MANAGE WAREHOUSES\n* IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON SNOWFLAKE DB\n* READ SESSION\n* EXECUTE ALERT\n\n## Using automated granting of privileges during upgrades ¶\n\nWhen publishing a new version of an app, you might need to add or remove the privileges\nrequired by the app. The setup script of the new version or patch runs with both the new auto\nprivileges specified in the manifest and the privileges required by the previous version. Any\nexcess privileges that are removed in the new version are revoked when the app upgrade is complete.\n\nTo ensure stability during upgrades, when the version of the manifest file is set to `2` , the\nlist of requested privileges in the manifest file cannot be modified as part of a patch. This\nprevents providers from unintentionally breaking apps by removing required privileges in a patch.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

After the 2024 breach exposed major customer data due to weak credential hygiene and lack of MFA, Snowflake is implementing progressive authentication improvements to enhance protections, and there’s no opting out.\nThis is a fundamental shift. Single-factor authentication is being deprecated. Native passwords for service users? Gone. MFA for all human users? Mandatory.\nIf you’re running a data platform on Snowflake and you’re not planning for this rollout, you’ll want to read on so you can catch up with these new updates. .\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Timeline: When the Changes Take Effect\nContent:\nFor Human Users:\nMay – July 2025: Mandatory MFA for all Snowsight users (existing + new)\nAug – Oct 2025: MFA required for all newly created human users (not just Snowsight)\nMar – May 2026: Mandatory MFA for all human users, no exceptions\nFor Service Users:\nNov 2025 – Jan 2026: No new LEGACY_SERVICE users can be created\nJune – Aug 2026: All remaining LEGACY_SERVICE users blocked. Key-pair or OAuth required\nThese timelines are tied to Snowflake’s monthly BCR bundle lifecycle. But don’t wait. You need to be proactive now to avoid outages, especially for automated pipelines and embedded workloads.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > 4. Enforce MFA Across the Board\nContent:\nYou don’t need to wait for Snowflake to enforce MFA. Apply your own authentication policy now:\n```\nCREATE AUTHENTICATION POLICY require_mfa\n\n  MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = ('PASSWORD')\n\n  MFA_ENROLLMENT = REQUIRED;\n\nALTER ACCOUNT SET AUTHENTICATION POLICY = require_mfa;\n```\nThis will override optional MFA for native users and lock down all TYPE = PERSON accounts that aren’t using SSO.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Snowflake’s Long-Term Security Vision: Federated Auth Everywhere\nContent:\nSnowflake’s long-term direction is clear: adopt federated identity everywhere. In 2025 and beyond, Snowflake will:\nSupport passkeys + authenticator apps (beyond DUO)\nImprove native OAuth support for connectors + drivers\nEnhance the Trust Center with org-wide insights, ML-based anomaly detection, and alerting\nEnable workload identity via cloud-native roles (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure Managed Identity)\nExpand mTLS support for secure bi-directional connections\nThese changes will reduce password reliance to near-zero.

This is the best way to guarantee complete data security for your Snowflake setup.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > TL;DR: Snowflake Is Moving.

This requires the consumer to grant the required privileges that allow the app\nto perform these actions.\n\nAuto privileges allow providers to specify the required privileges in the manifest file of\nan app. When the consumer installs or upgrades an app, the privileges specified in the manifest\nare automatically granted to the app by Snowflake.\n\n## Security considerations when using automated granting of privileges ¶\n\nWhen a provider configures an app to use `manifest_version: 2` in the manifest file, automated granting of\nprivileges is enabled. By default this allows Snowflake to automatically\ngrant certain privileges to the app. For information on the privileges\nthat can be automatically granted to the app, see Privileges granted by automated granting of privileges .\n\nDuring installation, Snowsight displays a notification about\nthe privileges requested by the app. When a consumer installs an app\nthat uses automated granting of privileges, they agree that the app may\nbe granted these privileges during upgrades without requiring additional\nconsent.\n\nConsumers can create feature policies that restrict the objects an app\ncan create. For more information on creating feature policies, see Use feature policies to limit the objects an app can create .\n\n## Privileges granted by automated granting of privileges ¶\n\nWhen using automated granting of privileges, a provider can add the following privileges to the manifest\nfile of the app:\n\n* EXECUTE TASK\n* EXECUTE MANAGED TASK\n* CREATE WAREHOUSE\n* CREATE COMPUTE POOL\n* BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT\n* CREATE DATABASE\n* CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION\n* CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION\n\nNote\n\nFor restrictions on the CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION privilege, see Restrictions on the CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION and CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION .\n\n## Restrictions on the CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION and CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION ¶\n\nThe CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION and CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION privileges allows an app\nto create the objects in the consumer account that are required to connect to an external endpoint.\nHowever, to allow connections to an external endpoint, consumers must also approve the app specification\nwhich allows the app to connect to external hosts. If a consumer does not approve the app specification,\nthe external connection remains disabled.\n\nFor more information, see Approve app specifications .\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.
