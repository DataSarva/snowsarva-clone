It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Business Impact > Overview > Consider cost as a design constraint\nContent:\nAt the ingestion layer, best practices include balancing latency versus\ncost by selecting appropriate services (e.g., Snowpipe, Snowpipe\nStreaming, or third-party tools) and choosing the right storage format\n(e.g., native tables, Iceberg). For transformations, design with\nfrequency versus SLA in mind to ensure data freshness matches the\nbusiness need. For analytics, apply schema design best practices such as\nthoughtful clustering key choices and pruning strategies to reduce\nconsumed credits. In distribution, optimize data transfer by monitoring\negress patterns and applying cost-saving practices like the [Snowflake Data Transfer Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) .\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Track usage data for all platform resources**\nTo deliver clear and actionable consumption insights, it is essential to\nleverage the rich usage data that Snowflake natively provides. The\nfoundation for all cost visibility is the **SNOWFLAKE** database, which\ncontains two key schemas for this purpose: [ACCOUNT_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) (for granular, account-level data) and [ORGANIZATION_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage) (for a consolidated view across all accounts).\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Visibility > Overview > Deliver clear historical consumption insights\nContent:\n**Snowsight's built-in cost management capabilities:** Snowsight\nprovides pre-built visuals for usage and credit monitoring directly\nwithin the [Snowflake Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) . It allows filtering by tags (e.g., view cost by department tag),\ncredit consumption by object types, and cost insights to optimize the\nplatform. **Creating custom dashboards or Streamlit apps for different stakeholder groups:** Snowsight facilitates the creation of custom\ndashboards using ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE views. Custom\ncharts in the Dashboards feature and Streamlit apps can both be easily\nshared. Combined with cost allocation and tagging, this allows for\ntailored views for finance managers (aggregated spend), engineering\nmanagers (warehouse utilization), or data analysts (query\nperformance).\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Optimize > Overview > Limit data transfer\nContent:\nData egress, the transfer of data from one cloud provider or region to\nanother, can incur substantial costs, particularly when handling large\ndata volumes. Implementing appropriate tools and best practices is\nessential to minimize these data transfer expenses and maximize business\nvalue when data egress is necessary.\n**Tooling: Enable proactive cost management**\nLeverage Snowflake's native features to gain visibility and control over\ndata transfer costs before they become a significant expense."]},{"url":"https://hakkoda.io/resources/native-apps-for-snowflake/","title":"Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide | Blog - Hakkoda","publish_date":"2024-05-23","excerpts":["Section Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide\nContent:\nExplore the flexible pricing models available for businesses looking to monetize their data using Native Apps for Snowflake.\nHakkoda,\nEmpowering Data-driven organizations\nMay 23, 2024\nShare\n[Data Cloud Summit 2024](https://www.snowflake.com/summit/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=na-us-en-brand-summit-phrase&utm_content=go-rsa-evp-evp-summit2024&utm_term=c-g-data%20cloud%20summit-p-692483594630&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwr7ayBhAPEiwA6EIGxGz8CzcwwSEndtlI1XikPxDtiS_Nx9rUddz8_06h3Sc1UrhKMK_KpxoCApwQAvD_BwE) is right around the corner, and [no one is surprised to see AI make an appearance](https://hakkoda.io/resources/ai-solutions-for-enterprise/) in this year’s event messaging: “Build the Future with AI and Apps.” But the other, softly overshadowed, half of that tagline gestures to another major trend that says just as much about Snowflake’s position in the marketplace: the cross-industry data monetization craze.\n ... \nSection Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide > The Two Main Pricing Models Explained\nContent:\nConversely, the **subscription-based plan** provides a more predictable payment model where consumers commit to a fixed term, typically benefiting from uninterrupted access to the application. This model can include options for recurring billing, facilitating a consistent revenue stream for providers with data products that see more consistent, higher volume use. This model is well-suited for apps that offer ongoing value or require regular engagement, thereby encouraging long-term commitments from buyers.\nBoth of these models present unique advantages, making it crucial for providers to carefully assess their app’s characteristics and customer usage patterns when choosing the most appropriate pricing strategy.\n ... \nSection Title: Native Apps for Snowflake: A Monetization Guide > Maximizing Revenue with Strategic Pricing\nContent:\nTo ensure your Native App achieves its revenue potential on the Snowflake marketplace, a nuanced approach to pricing is paramount.\nThis means moving beyond merely setting a price to embracing a comprehensive strategy that includes engaging with the marketplace dynamics, understanding the needs of your audience, and aligning your pricing with the value delivered.\nOne key element of this process involves using market research to identify trends and preferences, ensuring your app’s pricing is competitive while adequately reflecting its unique value proposition. Experimentation also plays a critical role. Additionally, leveraging analytics to monitor how pricing changes affect user acquisition and retention can provide actionable insights, enabling ongoing optimization.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Monetizing Your Native Apps in Snowflake with Hakkōda\nContent:\n[A Modern Data Foundation for Intelligent Invoice Reconciliation](https://hakkoda.io/resources/intelligent-invoice-reconciliation/)\nExplore how intelligent invoice reconciliation built on a modern data foundation can reduce errors, save time, and improve financial accuracy...\n[cost tracking](https://hakkoda.io/resources/tag/cost-tracking/) [data modernization](https://hakkoda.io/resources/tag/data-modernization/) [generative ai](https://hakkoda.io/resources/tag/generative-ai/)\n[Read more](https://hakkoda.io/resources/intelligent-invoice-reconciliation/)\nBlog\nJanuary 30, 2026\n[Connecting SAP and Snowflake for Real Outcomes and Operationalized AI](https://hakkoda.io/resources/connecting-sap-and-snowflake/)\nExplore how retailers are operationalizing AI by connecting SAP and Snowflake to enable trusted data, faster decisions, and growth."]},{"url":"https://www.snowflake.com/en/pricing-options/cost-and-performance-optimization/","title":"FinOps on Snowflake: Built-In Cost and Performance Control","excerpts":["Section Title: FinOps on Snowflake\nContent:\nTime is money – save both with Snowflake.\n[explore the economic impact of snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/resource/forrester-the-total-economic-impact-of-the-snowflake-ai-data-cloud/?utm_cta=website-cost-and-performance-forrester-tei)\n ... \nSection Title: FinOps on Snowflake > Maximize your Snowflake spend\nContent:\nAdd flexibility in how you use funds committed in your Snowflake Capacity contract.\nDeploy partner solutions faster by simplifying finance and procurement processes.\nBundle your spend to increase your buying power with Snowflake and partners.\nlearn more\n ... \nSection Title: FinOps on Snowflake > Saving time on platform admin.
