It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Principles > Business impact: Align cost with business value\nContent:\nConnect cloud spending directly to business outcomes, ensuring that every dollar spent in the cloud contributes meaningfully to strategic objectives and demonstrable value. Embed cost considerations directly into platform planning and architecture considerations.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Control: Establish guardrails and governance\nContent:\nEstablish policies and mechanisms to govern resource provisioning and consumption, preventing unnecessary costs and enforcing financial boundaries.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview\nContent:\nThe Control principle of the Cost Optimization framework is designed to\nmove organizations beyond cost reporting by establishing the necessary\nautomated guardrails and governance policies to manage and secure\nSnowflake consumption proactively. This framework enforces financial\ngovernance by transforming cost visibility into tangible action,\nutilizing features like budgets and resource monitors to prevent\nuncontrolled growth and ensure consumption aligns strictly with\norganizational financial policies. Control is foundational for\nmaximizing the value of the platform by ensuring disciplined and\ncost-effective resource utilization.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources\nContent:\nTo effectively manage Snowflake expenditure and prevent unforeseen\ncosts, it is crucial to implement a robust framework of resource\ncontrols. These controls act as automated guardrails, ensuring that\nresource consumption for compute, storage, and other services aligns\nwith your financial governance policies. By proactively setting policies\nand remediating inefficiencies, you can maintain budget predictability\nand maximize the value of your investment in the platform.\n**Compute controls**\nControlling compute consumption is often the most critical aspect of\nSnowflake cost management, as it typically represents the largest\nportion of spend. Snowflake offers several features to manage warehouse\nusage and prevent excessive costs.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Govern resource creation and administration\nContent:\n**Centralized management:** A dedicated team, such as a platform\nCenter of Excellence (CoE), handles resource creation and\nadministration policies. This ensures consistency, adheres to best\npractices, and facilitates robust cost control. This model is ideal\nfor large enterprises where strict governance and chargeback are\nparamount.\n**Decentralized management:** Individual business units or teams\nmanage their own resources. This provides greater autonomy and speed\nbut can lead to resource sprawl, inconsistent practices, and\nsignificant cost inefficiencies if not properly governed.\n**Striking the balance: the federated model**\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Govern resource creation and administration\nContent:\nThe most effective strategy often lies in a hybrid, or federated, model.\nThis approach combines centralized governance (policies defined by a\nCoE) with decentralized execution (teams having the freedom to create\nresources within those guardrails). This balance enables agility while\nmitigating financial risk.\n**Core Principles for Governance**\nRegardless of the chosen model, these principles are essential for\neffective governance:\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > Control > Overview > Govern resource creation and administration\nContent:\nThis ensures every credit spent can be\naccurately attributed to the correct department or project, enabling\nrobust chargeback and accountability. **Automate deactivation:** To prevent object sprawl, implement\npolicies that identify and deactivate stale resources after a\npredetermined period of disuse."]},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors","title":"Working with resource monitors | Snowflake Documentation","excerpts":["Section Title: Working with resource monitors ¶ > Resource monitor properties ¶\nContent:\nA resource monitor is a first-class object in Snowflake, consisting of the following properties:\nSection Title: Working with resource monitors ¶ > Resource monitor properties ¶ > Credit quota ¶\nContent:\nCredit quota specifies the number of Snowflake credits allocated to the monitor for the specified frequency interval.
