As organizations increasingly adopt containerized workloads for data processing, understanding how OpenFlow leverages SPCS becomes crucial for data engineers and architects. This comprehensive guide explores the architecture, deployment mechanics, and cost implications of running OpenFlow on SPCS.\n\n## What is OpenFlow SPCS Deployment?\n\nOpenFlow — Snowflake Deployment is a containerized approach to running data integration workloads directly within Snowflake’s infrastructure. Unlike traditional BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) deployments, SPCS deployments eliminate the need to manage your own Kubernetes clusters while providing enterprise-grade security, scalability, and integration with Snowflake’s data platform.\n\n## The Four-Pool Architecture\n\nWhen you deploy Openflow on SPCS, Snowflake automatically creates **four distinct compute pools** to handle different aspects of the deployment:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n## Runtime-to-Pool Mapping and Shared Resources\n\nOne of the most important concepts to understand is that **runtime pools are shared resources** . When you create multiple runtimes of the same type, they don’t get individual pools. Instead:\n\n* All Small runtimes share `INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_SMALL`\n* All Medium runtimes share `INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_MEDIUM`\n* All Large runtimes share `INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_LARGE`\n\n## Example Scenario:\n\nIf you create 3 Small runtimes with different configurations:\n\n* Runtime A: Min 1 node, Max 5 nodes\n* Runtime B: Min 2 nodes, Max 10 nodes\n* Runtime C: Min 1 node, Max 3 nodes\n\nAll three runtimes will share the `INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_SMALL` pool, and the pool will scale based on the **total demand** from all three runtimes combined.\n\n## Scaling Mechanics and Resource Allocation\n\n## Dynamic Scaling Behavior\n\nThe compute pools exhibit intelligent scaling characteristics:\n\n1. **Scale-to-Zero** : Runtime pools scale down to 0 instances after 600 seconds without demand\n2. **Demand-Driven** : Pools scale up based on CPU consumption and runtime requirements\n3. **Maximum Constraints** : Each pool has a hard limit of 50 instances\n4. **Instant Provisioning** : New instances are provisioned rapidly to meet demand spikes\n\n## Resource Efficiency Example\n\nConsider a Small runtime scaling from 1 to 50 nodes:\n\n**At 1 Node:**\n\n* Pool instances: 1 CPU\\_X64\\_S instance\n* Total available: 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM\n* Runtime usage: 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM\n\n**At 50 Nodes:**\n\n* Pool instances: 50 CPU\\_X64\\_S instances\n* Total available: 200 vCPUs, 800 GB RAM\n* Runtime usage: 50 vCPUs, 100 GB RAM\n\n## Cost Implications and Optimization Strategies\n\n## Understanding the Cost Structure\n\n**Continuous Costs:**\n\n* Control Pool: Always charges 1 CPU\\_X64\\_S instance-hour when deployment exists\n* Monthly baseline: ~720 CPU\\_X64\\_S instance-hours (24×30 days)\n\n**Variable Costs:**\n\n* Runtime pools: Scale based on actual usage\n* Charged per-second with 5-minute minimums\n* Different instance types have different hourly rates\n\n## Cost Optimization Strategies\n\n1. **Right-Size Runtime Types** : Choose the smallest runtime type that meets your performance needs\n2. **Optimize Scaling Configuration** : Set appropriate min/max node values to balance performance and cost\n3. **Consider Deployment Lifecycle** : Delete deployments when not in use to eliminate control plane charges\n4. **Monitor Usage Patterns** : Use account usage views to track consumption and identify optimization opportunities\n\n## Deployment Management Operations\n\n## Creating a Deployment\n\nOpenflow deployments can be created through:\n\n* Snowsight web interface\n* Snowflake CLI\n* REST APIs\n\n## Suspending vs. Deleting\n\n**Important** : There’s no “suspend” option for Openflow deployments. Your choices are:\n\n* **Active** : Control plane runs continuously, incurring charges\n* **Deleted** : Complete removal, all charges stop immediately\n\n## Monitoring and Observability\n\nSeveral account usage views provide insight into Openflow consumption:\n\n* `OPENFLOW_USAGE_HISTORY` : Runtime-specific usage tracking\n* `METERING_DAILY_HISTORY` : Daily aggregated consumption\n* `METERING_HISTORY` : Hourly consumption data\n\n## Best Practices for Production Deployments\n\n## 1\\. Capacity Planning\n\n* Estimate peak runtime requirements across all runtime types\n* Account for shared pool resource contention\n* Plan for control plane costs in total cost of ownership\n\n## 2\\. Security Considerations\n\n* Leverage Snowflake’s built-in RBAC for deployment access control\n* Use network policies to restrict connectivity\n* Implement proper secrets management for connectors\n\n## 3\\. Performance Optimization\n\n* Monitor CPU utilization across runtime pools\n* Adjust runtime min/max settings based on workload patterns\n* Consider data locality for optimal performance\n\n## 4\\. Cost Management\n\n* Implement tagging and cost allocation strategies\n* Set up alerting for unexpected usage spikes\n* Regular review of deployment necessity and utilization\n\n## **Comparison: SPCS vs. BYOC Deployments**\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n## Future Considerations\n\nAs OpenFlow SPCS continues to evolve, expect enhancements in:\n\n* More granular cost controls\n* Additional runtime type options\n* Enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities\n* Improved integration with Snowflake’s data governance features\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOpenFlow SPCS deployment represents a powerful paradigm for running containerized data workloads within Snowflake’s ecosystem. The four-pool architecture provides flexibility and scalability while the shared resource model ensures cost efficiency. However, success requires careful consideration of the cost implications, particularly the continuous control plane charges.\n\nFor organizations evaluating OpenFlow deployment options, SPCS offers reduced operational overhead at the cost of less infrastructure control. The decision ultimately depends on your organization’s priorities regarding operational complexity, cost structure, and integration requirements.\n\nUnderstanding these architectural details empowers data teams to make informed decisions about deployment strategies, capacity planning, and cost optimization in their OpenFlow implementations.\n\nSnowflake Data Cloud\n\nOpenflow\n\nSnowpark Container\n\nSnowpark\n\n\\-- \n\n\\--\n\n## Written by Karthick Ramamoorthy\n\n1 follower\n\n· 6 following\n\n## No responses yet\n\n[](https://policy.medium.com/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4?source=post_page---post_responses--e1ed7d703d9a---------------------------------------)"],"full_content":null},{"url":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-overall","title":"Understanding overall cost | Snowflake Documentation","publish_date":null,"excerpts":["[DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.snowflake.com)\n\n/\n\nGet started\n\nGuides\n\nDeveloper\n\nReference\n\nRelease notes\n\nTutorials\n\n[Status](https://status.snowflake.com)\n\nGuides Cost & Billing Understanding cost\n\n# Understanding overall cost ¶\n\nNote\n\nThis topic describes foundational costs associated with using Snowflake (compute costs, storage costs, and data transfer costs).\nSpecific Snowflake features (for example, Snowflake Cortex and Snowpark Container Services) incur costs in unique ways, and are not\ndiscussed in this topic.\n\n## How are costs incurred? ¶\n\nThe total cost of using Snowflake is the aggregate of the cost of using data transfer, storage, and compute resources. Snowflake’s\ninnovative cloud architecture separates the cost of accomplishing any task into one of these\nusage types.\n\nCompute Resources\n    Using compute resources within Snowflake consumes Snowflake credits. The billed cost of using compute resources is\ncalculated by multiplying the number of consumed credits by the price of a credit. For the current price of a credit, see the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\n\nThere are three types of compute resources that consume credits within Snowflake:\n\n* **Virtual Warehouse Compute** : Virtual warehouses are user-managed compute resources that consume\n  credits when loading data, executing queries, and performing other DML operations. Because Snowflake utilizes per-second billing (with a\n  60-second minimum each time the warehouse starts), warehouses are billed only for the credits they actually consume when they are\n  actively working.\n* **Serverless Compute** : There are Snowflake features such as Search Optimization and Snowpipe that use Snowflake-managed compute\n  resources rather than virtual warehouses. To minimize cost, these serverless compute resources are automatically resized and scaled\n  up or down by Snowflake as required for each workload.\n* **Cloud Services Compute** : The cloud services layer of the Snowflake architecture consumes credits as it performs behind-the-scenes\n  tasks such as authentication, metadata management, and access control. Usage of the cloud services layer is charged only if the daily\n  consumption of cloud services resources exceeds 10% of the daily warehouse usage.\n\nFor more details about compute costs, see Understanding compute cost .\nStorage Resources\n    The monthly cost for storing data in Snowflake is based on a flat rate per terabyte (TB). For the current rate, which\nvaries depending on your type of account (Capacity or On Demand) and region (US or EU), see the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\n\nStorage is calculated monthly based on the average number of on-disk bytes stored each day in your Snowflake account.\n\nFor more details about storage costs, see Understanding storage cost .\nData Transfer Resources\n    Snowflake does not charge data ingress fees to bring data into your account, but does charge for data egress.\n\nSnowflake charges a per-terabyte fee when you transfer data from a Snowflake account into a different region on the same cloud platform or into a completely different cloud platform. This fee for data egress depends on the region where your Snowflake account is hosted. For details,\nsee the [Snowflake Pricing Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/) .\n\nFor more details about data transfer costs, see Understanding data transfer cost .\n\n## Total cost example ¶\n\nThe following example provides insight into the total cost in Snowflake to load and query data.\n\nSuppose an organization loads data constantly, 24x7. It has two different groups of users (Finance and Sales) using the database in\noverlapping, but different times of the day. It also runs a weekly batch report. This organization:\n\n* Uses the Standard Edition of Snowflake.\n* Stores an average of 65 TBs of compressed data (compare with 325 TB without compression).\n* Loads data 24x7x365. They use a Small Standard virtual warehouse for this purpose.\n* Enables seven finance users to work 5 days a week from 8am until 5pm using a Large Standard virtual warehouse.\n* Enables twelve sales users in different geographies to work a total of 16 hours a day (across Europe and the Americas), 5 days a\n  week using a Medium Standard virtual warehouse.\n* Runs a complex weekly report every Friday. This report takes approximately 2 hours to run on a 2X-Large standard warehouse.\n\n**Data Loading Requirements**\n\n|Parameter |Customer Requirement |Configuration |Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Loading Window |24 x 7 x 365 |Small Standard Virtual Warehouse (2 credits/hr) |1,488 credits\n(2 credits/hr x 24 hours per day x 31 days per month) |\n\n**Storage Requirements**\n\n|Data set size (per month) |65 TB (after compression) |\n| --- | --- |\n\n**Compute Requirements**\n\n|Parameter |Customer Requirement |Configuration |Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Finance Users |5 Users, 8am-5pm (9 hours) |Large Standard Virtual Warehouse (8 credits/hr) |1,440 credits (8 credits/hr x 9 hours per day x 20 days per month) |\n|Sales Users |12 Users, 16 hour time slot |Medium Standard Virtual Warehouse (4 credits/hr) |1,280 (4 credits/hr x 16 hours per day x 20 days per month) |\n|Complex Query Users |1 User, 2 hours/day |2X Standard Virtual Warehouse (32 credits/hr) |256 (32 credits/hr x 2 hours per day x 4 days per month) |\n\n**Total Cost**\n\n|Usage Type |Monthly Cost |Total Billed Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Compute Cost |4,464 credits (@ $2/credit) |$8928 |\n|Storage Cost |65 TB (@ $23/TB) |$1495 |\n|$10,423 |\n\n**Next Topics**\n\n* Understanding compute cost\n* Understanding storage cost\n* Understanding data transfer cost\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\nShare your feedback\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\nOn this page\n\n1.

Chaos Genius has been [acquired by Flexera](https://www.flexera.com/more/ProsperOps-Chaos-Genius) .\n\nWouldn’t it be great to run [containers](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-are-containers) right where your data lives, in a secure and governed space? Up until now, you’ve had to rely on external container platforms that typically force you to copy data out of your database and into cloud storage or other servers, adding latency and risk. **_Snowpark Container Services (SPCS)_** changes that: you bring your containers to Snowflake instead. Now you can build, run, scale and deploy containerized applications and services all inside Snowflake, with security built in and direct access to your data. There’s no need to manually shuffle data around. It’s a simpler approach: instead of moving data to compute, you bring compute to the data, saving you from expensive data movement.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about Snowpark Container Services, from core concepts to a hands-on setup guide. Here, you will learn how to set up Snowflake compute pools, push container images, define service specifications and deploy your first containerized workload.\n\n## What is Snowpark Container Services?\n\n_Snowpark Container Services (SPCS)_ is a fully managed container service integrated into Snowflake. You push [Open Container Initiative-compliant images](https://opencontainers.org/) to your account’s private Open Container Initiative (OCI) image registry, then run those images as long-running services, finite Snowflake job services, or callable Snowflake service functions on Snowflake-managed compute pools.\n\nSnowflake SPCS guarantees that data remains secure and generally does not leave Snowflake’s governed environment unless explicitly configured by the user for external access; your containers have fast local access to tables, stages and even secrets via Snowflake’s security integrations. You also benefit from Snowflake’s native features, such as role-based access control (RBAC) , governance , monitoring and auto-scaling.\n\nSnowpark Container Services Overview (Source: [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) )\n\nAs of 2025, Snowpark Container Services is generally available across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform commercial regions, with some exceptions (e.g., not available in most government regions or the Google Cloud me-central2 region). It is unavailable for trial accounts except for running notebooks. Check out [Snowflake’s documentation for the latest region availability](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) .\n\nAccording to [Snowflake’s official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) :\n\n> Snowpark Container Services is a fully managed container offering designed to facilitate the deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications within the Snowflake ecosystem. This service enables users to run containerized workloads directly within Snowflake, ensuring that data doesn’t need to be moved out of the Snowflake environment for processing. Unlike traditional container orchestration platforms like Docker or Kubernetes, Snowpark Container Services offers an OCI runtime execution environment specifically optimized for Snowflake. This integration allows for the seamless execution of OCI images, leveraging Snowflake’s robust data platform.\n> \n> \n\n### Snowpark Container Services Core Concepts Explained\n\nSnowflake manages the container runtime, scheduling, scaling and patching. You provide the container image and the service or job specification.  \nContainers can execute SQL or call Snowflake APIs to read from and write to tables and stages. Access is controlled via Snowflake roles and policies.  \nEach Snowflake account includes a private OCI-compliant image registry. You push images there and Snowflake pulls them when launching services or jobs.  \nSnowflake Compute pools are sets of VM nodes that host your services and jobs. Pools autoscale between a minimum and maximum node count, with choices for instance families (including GPU-enabled options where supported).  \nSupports any programming language or framework inside the container, including GPU acceleration for AI/ML workloads.  \nOffers three workload models: long-running services (auto-restarting), Snowflake job services (batch or one-off tasks that run to completion) and Snowflake service functions (callable endpoints for SQL-bound computations).\n\n### Key Features and Capabilities of Snowpark Container Services\n\nHere are all the key notable features of Snowpark Container Services:\n\n#### **Feature 1: Managed Container Runtime**\n\nSnowflake handles the orchestration and scaling of your containers. You don’t have to run your own [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/) you just tell Snowflake the compute you need (via a Snowflake compute pool) and it spins up nodes as needed.\n\n#### **Feature 2: Any language & libraries**\n\nYou’re not limited to Snowpark Python or SQL. Use any programming language (Python, Node.js, C++, R, Java) and any Linux libraries inside your container. There’s no need to rewrite code for Snowflake; just containerize it.\n\n#### **Feature 3: OCI Image Registry**\n\nSnowflake provides a built-in Open Container Initiative (OCI) v2 registry. You can push/pull images using Docker CLI or SnowCLI and Snowflake stores them (encrypted) in a stage. The registry is accessible only to your account roles.\n\n#### **Feature 4: Workload Types**\n\nSnowpark Container Services supports: _long-running services_ (APIs with auto-restarts), Snowflake _job services_ (batch tasks that exit upon completion) and Snowflake _service functions_ (SQL-callable endpoints).\n\n#### **Feature 5: Snowpark Data Integration**\n\nContainers can use Snowpark and Snowflake connectors inside them. Snowflake even provides a short-lived OAuth token ( `/snowflake/session/token` ) to easily connect from inside a container back to Snowflake.\n\n#### **Feature 6: GPU Acceleration**\n\nSnowflake provides GPU-enabled Snowflake compute pools for AI/ML workloads, so you can train or serve [large models (like LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) right in the platform.\n\n#### **Feature 7: Data Access**\n\nContainers can access Snowflake tables and stages directly. You can mount a Snowflake stage as a volume in a container (reads as regular files) or use Snowpark APIs inside the container to query data. You can even export query results directly into your app.\n\n#### **Feature 8: Security & Networking**\n\nSnowpark Container Services comes with built-in Snowflake security (IAM roles, private networking, secrets). Containers, by default, have no outbound Internet access; you must explicitly grant egress via [Snowflake External Access Integrations](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration) . You can also mount Snowflake stages as volumes (subject to privileges).\n\n#### **Feature 9: Observability**\n\nYou can log container output and Snowflake can capture logs and metrics from services into event tables or system views.\n\n### Common Use Cases for Snowpark Container Services\n\nSnowpark Container Services excels in scenarios where applications need tight integration with Snowflake data:\n\n* **Advanced Analytics and ML/AI** — Run models or pipelines in-place. Deploy real-time inference services with REST endpoints or fine-tune LLMs on proprietary data using GPUs.\n* **Bring-Your-Own-Language** — Maybe you have C++ or R code that processes data. Package it into a container and run it on Snowflake data. Even COBOL or Java/.NET jobs can run inside Snowpark Container Services.\n* **External Caches or DBs** — If you use a specialized store (like a vector database, Redis cache, or any microservice), you can run it as a container next to your Snowflake data.\n* **ETL and Pipeline** — Instead of extracting to an external server, write your ETL logic as a container. It can pull raw data from a stage, transform it and load it into tables, all on Snowflake machines.\n* **Full-Stack Apps and Tools** — You could even run tools like Metabase or Grafana in Snowpark Container Services.\n* **Third-Party and Partner Apps** — Snowflake’s own ecosystem (Native Apps marketplace) will host containerized apps from partners on Snowpark Container Services. As an engineer, you could also deploy your company’s custom app via SPCS.\n\nTL;DR: Snowpark Container Services suits any containerizable app that interacts with Snowflake data or benefits from co-location. If your data team wants to run Python scripts, APIs, ML models, or even web UIs without leaving the Snowflake platform, Snowpark Container Services is the right tool.\n\nNext, we’ll deep dive into how it works under the hood.\n\n## Snowpark Container Services Architecture Components and Technical Design\n\n**Snowpark Container Services Architecture TL;DR:** Snowpark Container Services (SPCS) runs OCI images inside Snowflake on managed compute pools. You push images to Snowflake’s private OCI registry, create a compute pool with an instance family and node limits, then define services or job services via a YAML spec. Long-running services are restarted automatically. Job services run to completion. Service functions expose container endpoints as SQL-callable functions. Outbound networking is blocked by default and must be allowed via External Access Integrations or private connectivity. Secrets, caller’s rights, volumes, logging and monitoring are built into the SPCS spec and control plane.\n\nSnowpark Container Services Architecture (Source: [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services) )\n\n### How Snowpark Container Services(SPCS) pieces fit together?\n\nHere’s how it all works together:\n\n### **Snowflake Compute Pools (the runtime hosts)**\n\nA compute pool is your container “warehouse”. It is a collection of virtual machines (nodes) that Snowflake manages for you. Whenever you create a pool, you pick an instance family (CPU\\_X64\\_S for small CPU-optimized, or a GPU family for ML) and set the minimum and maximum number of nodes. Snowflake will auto-scale the pool between those limits based on workload. If your services need more containers, Snowflake spins up additional nodes (up to your max). If they sit idle, it can remove nodes down to the minimum.\n\n### **Image Registry & Repository**\n\nEach Snowflake account has a private OCI-compliant container registry. Within that registry you create image repositories (like namespaces or projects) to hold your Docker images. When you build a Docker image, you tag it with your Snowflake registry’s hostname and push it there. This registry, by default, is private to your account. Snowflake provides commands (or a Docker login mechanism) to authenticate and upload images.\n\n### **Service types: Services vs Jobs vs Service Functions**\n\nOnce your image is in the registry, you run it by creating a **service** (long-running), executing a Snowflake **job service** (batch) or Snowflake **service functions** .\n\n**Snowflake Service** is like a forever running container. It might host an API or continuously process a queue. When you fire up the command `CREATE SERVICE` , you link it to a Snowflake compute pool and give a YAML spec for containers and endpoints. Snowflake ensures this service keeps running – if a container crashes, it restarts it.\n\n**Snowflake Job service** is one and done. You run it with Snowflake `EXECUTE JOB SERVICE` , Snowflake spins up the containers on the specified Snowflake compute pool, they run your workload, then exit and the job is marked complete. Jobs do not auto restart. You can request parallel replicas with the REPLICAS parameter; Snowflake will coordinate the data split (via special `SNOWFLAKE_JOB_INDEX` env var).\n\n**Snowflake Service functions** are function as a service endpoints exposed by a service. A service implements a REST POST endpoint; a SQL-level function is then defined to call that endpoint. Calls follow the external function call pattern but execute inside Snowflake’s network boundary so your data does not leave Snowflake.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Service = always on and auto restarting.\n* Snowflake Job service = run to completion, optionally parallel.\n* Snowflake Service function = callable, data local function exposed to SQL.\n\n### **Service specification (YAML)**\n\nBoth services and jobs use a YAML spec to describe the container(s) to run, any environment variables, ports and endpoints. For a service, you often define an HTTP endpoint so external clients can call it. You might specify one container named “app” using your image, listening on port 80 and an endpoint named “http” that maps to that port. Snowflake then takes care of load-balancing requests to your containers.\n\n### **Networking: ingress, egress, private connectivity**\n\n**Ingress**\n\n* You can expose endpoints as public. Snowflake provides a stable ingress URL and proxy for public endpoints. Use `SHOW ENDPOINTS IN SERVICE` to get the `ingress_url` .\n\n**Egress**\n\n* Containers have no unrestricted outbound internet access. To allow controlled outbound calls, you must create an External Access Integration with explicit network rules and secrets, then reference it when creating or executing a service or function (via `EXTERNAL_ACCESS_INTEGRATIONS` ). This lets you whitelist hostnames and permit specific secret usage.\n\n**Inter-service traffic**\n\n* Containers running inside Snowflake communicate over Snowflake’s internal network. You can design multi-container apps and mount volumes for shared data. Different Snowflake compute pools can be used for isolation while allowing application containers to communicate as required.\n\n### **Identity and Access**\n\nWhen a container runs, Snowflake injects temporary credentials so it can connect back to the Snowflake account using a specified role. The container runs as the “ **owner** ” role of the service (the role that created it) by default. You can also reference Snowflake **secrets** in your spec (using `containers.secrets` ) to provide any credentials or API keys to the container securely.\n\n### **Autoscaling and Lifecycles**\n\nAfter creation, a Snowflake compute pool starts at your `MIN_NODES` . When more containers need space, new nodes come up automatically. If containers idle away, nodes scale down (but not below `MIN_NODES` ). You can configure the pool to suspend (free all nodes) after inactivity ( `AUTO_SUSPEND` ). A suspended pool incurs no compute cost. You can also set `AUTO_RESUME` so it restarts when you next run a service.\n\nNext, we’ll go through step-by-step through setting Snowpark Container Service up from scratch.\n\n* * *\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Snowpark Container Services\n\nNow, we will walk through the process of launching your first Snowpark Container Service. You’ll need the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role (or an equivalent) to set this up. Before you begin, however, make sure you have the following prerequisites:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* A Snowflake account (a non-trial account in a supported AWS region). You need privileges to create Snowflake compute pools, image repositories and services; this typically requires [ACCOUNTADMIN](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-considerations) or an equivalent role.\n* [Snow CLI (snow) / SnowCLI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index) installed for convenient SPCS commands (snow spcs). SnowCLI handles packaging and provides a push login helper.\n* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or an OCI builder) to build images locally.\n* [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.\n* **Privileges** : `CREATE COMPUTE POOL` on account, `CREATE IMAGE REPOSITORY` on schema, `CREATE SERVICE` and privileges on any database objects you’ll access. Create roles and grant privileges as needed.\n* **Networking Plan** : If containers need outbound access, plan External Access Integration rules and secrets.\n\nStart by logging into Snowflake via Snowsight or Snowflake CLI.\n\n> Check out this article to learn more about [how to install and configure Snowflake CLI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/installation/installation) .\n> \n> \n\nJust make sure you have the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role active.\n\n### **Step 2** —Create Core Snowflake Objects and Roles\n\nFirst, make sure you switch to a role that can create objects.\n\n```\nUSE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;\n```\n\nNext, create a role called `spcs_role` .\n\n```\nCREATE ROLE spcs_role;\n```\n\nThen, run the following SQL commands to grant all the necessary privileges for that role:\n\n```\nGRANT CREATE DATABASE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE spcs_role;\nGRANT CREATE WAREHOUSE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE spcs_role;\nGRANT CREATE COMPUTE POOL ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE spcs_role;\nGRANT CREATE INTEGRATION ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE spcs_role;\nGRANT MONITOR USAGE ON ACCOUNT TO\tROLE\tspcs_role;\nGRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE snowflake TO ROLE spcs_role;\n```\n\nGranting necessary privileges to spcs\\_role Snowflake role – Snowpark Container Services\n\nAlso, do not forget to allow the role to bind service endpoints. This privilege is needed if you plan to create public endpoints for your services:\n\n```\nGRANT BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE spcs_role;\n```\n\nThen, `grant spcs_role` to `ACCOUNTADMIN` .\n\n```\nGRANT ROLE spcs_role to role ACCOUNTADMIN;\n```\n\nGranting spcs\\_role to ACCOUNTADMIN role – Snowflake Snowpark Container Services\n\nOnce all that is done, create the Database, Warehouse and Image Spec Stage.\n\n```\nUSE ROLE spcs_role;\n\nCREATE\nOR REPLACE DATABASE spcs_demo_db;\n\nCREATE\nOR REPLACE WAREHOUSE spcs_demo_wh WAREHOUSE_SIZE = XSMALL AUTO_SUSPEND = 120 AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;\n\nCREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS specs ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');\n\nCREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS volumes ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE') DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE);\n```\n\nCreating Database, Warehouse, & Image Spec Stage – Snowpark Container Services\n\nAdjust names as needed for your environment. From here on, we’ll work under `spcs_role` .\n\n### **Step 3** —Set Up Snowflake Compute Pool\n\nSnowflake **compute pool** is a new Snowflake object that provides the compute resources (VMs) for containers. To create one, use [CREATE COMPUTE POOL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool) and specify the minimum and maximum nodes, plus an instance family:\n\n```\nUSE ROLE spcs_role;\n\nCREATE COMPUTE POOL IF NOT EXISTS spcs_compute_pool\n\t MIN_NODES = 1\n\tMAX_NODES = 3\n\t INSTANCE_FAMILY = 'CPU_X64_M'\n\tAUTO_RESUME = TRUE\n\tAUTO_SUSPEND_SECS = 300;\n```\n\n* `INSTANCE_FAMILY` chooses the VM size. Here, `CPU_X64_M` means 6 vCPUs and ~28 GiB RAM per node. You might pick `CPU_X64_S` (3 vCPU, 13 GiB) or `CPU_X64_L` (28 vCPU, 116 GiB) depending on need. For GPUs, choose families like `GPU_NV_S` or `GPU_NV_M` (AWS with A10G GPUs).\n* `MIN_NODES` is the number of nodes to start with (and the floor to scale down to). `MAX_NODES` is how far it can grow. Snowflake will auto-scale between them.\n* `AUTO_RESUME = TRUE` tells Snowflake to automatically start the pool if you submit work when it’s suspended.\n* `AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS (optional)` is how long to wait with no activity before suspending the pool (turning off all nodes to save cost). Here we set 300 seconds. When suspended, the pool has no running nodes and incurs no compute charges.\n\n**Note on Autoscaling:** After you create the pool, Snowflake will start MIN\\_NODES nodes. As you run services, if more nodes are needed (beyond curr. capacity), Snowflake adds nodes automatically until MAX\\_NODES. If nodes sit idle, Snowflake removes them back down to MIN\\_NODES. You will be charged for the nodes that exist (in IDLE or ACTIVE state) as compute usage. Using AUTO\\_SUSPEND on the pool can eliminate idle charges by tearing down all nodes after inactivity.\n\n### **Step 4** —Set Up Image Registry (Create an Image Repository)\n\nNext, create a Snowflake [**image repository**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-image-repository) in Snowflake’s registry to hold your container images. This is like a folder for Docker images within Snowflake. For example:\n\n```\nCREATE IMAGE REPOSITORY spcs_demo_repo;\n```\n\nCreating image repository named spcs\\_demo\\_repo – Snowpark Container Services\n\nSnowflake encrypts images by default. Once the repository exists, note its URL. Each Snowflake account’s registry has a unique hostname of the form.\n\nTo view Snowflake image repository details, run the following command:\n\n```\nSHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES IN SCHEMA spcs_demo_db.public;\n```\n\nShowing image repositories in spcs\\_demo\\_db.public schema – Snowpark Container Services\n\nInternally, Snowflake will create a stage to hold the image layers. You don’t need to manage the storage; Snowflake handles it. But remember: any image you push to spcs\\_demo\\_repo is stored in your Snowflake account and incurs normal Snowflake stage storage costs.\n\n(Replace `<org>` and `<acct>` with your Snowflake organization and account name). As you can see, combined with your database, schema and repository, your full image path will look like:\n\n```\n<org>-<acct>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/spcs_demo_db/public/spcs_demo_repo\n```\n\n### **Step 5** —Verify Snowflake Objects\n\nDouble-check that the objects exist:\n\n```\nSHOW COMPUTE POOLS;\t\t\t\t -- should list my_pool as IDLE\nSHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '%WH%';\nSHOW DATABASES LIKE 'SPCS_DEMO_DB';\nSHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES;\t -- should show tutorial_repo\n```\n\nYou should see spcs\\_demo\\_db in state IDLE (no containers running yet) and your warehouse and database listed. This step is just sanity-checking your setup.\n\nIf you see errors, make sure your role has the right privileges on each object. Once these are set up, your Snowflake account is ready to accept container images and run services.\n\n### **Step 6** —Configure External Access (Optional)\n\nNote that containers in Snowflake, by default, cannot connect to the public internet. This is a security feature of Snowflake’s network. If your app needs to call an external API or service (for example, fetching from S3 or calling a third-party endpoint), you must explicitly allow it via Snowflake’s [External Access Integration (EAI)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/external-network-access/creating-using-external-network-access) . In short, you create network rules specifying allowed addresses and then tie them to an integration.\n\n* [**Create a Network Rule**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-network-rule) to whitelist external hosts/ports.\n* [**Create an External Access Integration (EAI)**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration) that uses those rules and grant your role usage on it.\n\nFor example, to allow all outbound HTTPS and HTTP traffic, you can define broad network rules like:\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE snowflake_network_rule\n\t TYPE = 'HOST_PORT'\n\t MODE = 'EGRESS'\n\tVALUE_LIST= ('0.0.0.0:443', '0.0.0.0:80');\n```\n\nCreating network rule for egress on ports 443 and 80 – Snowpark Container Services\n\nThen create an integration using that rule:\n\n```\nCREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION spcs_demo_eai\n\t ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (snowflake_network_rule)\n\t ENABLED = true;\n```\n\nCreating external access integration with network rule – Snowpark Container Services\n\nFinally, grant your role permission to use this integration:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION spcs_demo_eai TO ROLE spcs_role;\n```\n\nGranting usage on spcs\\_demo\\_eai to spcs\\_role – Snowflake Snowpark Container Services\n\nLater, when you create a service or job, you’ll reference `spcs_demo_eai (in EXTERNAL_ACCESS_INTEGRATIONS=(...))` so the container can make outbound calls. In production, you would tighten `VALUE_LIST` to specific domains to follow least-privilege networking.\n\nIf you don’t need external calls, skip this; internal Snowflake data access will still work normally.\n\n### **Step 7** —Re-Verify Compute Pool and Image Repository\n\nOne more quick check: make sure to re-run `SHOW COMPUTE POOLS;` and `SHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES;` to confirm your pool is running and registry is available. In Snowflake’s web UI (Snowsight), you can also browse the **Compute** > **Pools** page to see your pool and the **Stages** .\n\nAlso, confirm which account/region you’re on:\n\n```\nSELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT(), CURRENT_REGION();\n```\n\nIf you created a public endpoint (the BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT grant), check under API Endpoints to make sure your role can bind one.\n\nAlso, make sure to check the network rule by heading over to **Admin > Security > Network Rules** .\n\nVerifying Snowflake Network rule – Snowflake Snowpark Container Services\n\n### **Step 8** —Authenticate Docker to Snowflake\n\nNow, switch over to your local machine to prepare the Docker image. First things first, open your Docker Desktop app and also make sure your Snowflake CLI is successfully configured.\n\nThen authenticate your Docker client to Snowflake’s registry. Snowflake CLI makes this easy:\n\n```\nsnow spcs image-registry login\n```\n\nLogging into Snowflake image registry via SnowCLI – Snowpark Container Services\n\nOr, you can retrieve the login credentials and run:\n\n```\ndocker login <org>-<acct>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com -u <username> -p <password>\n```\n\nOnce logged in, your Docker CLI can pull/push images to your Snowflake registry host.\n\n### **Step 9** —Build and Test a Docker Image\n\nPrepare your application code and [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/dockerfile/) .\n\nLet’s create a simple Dockerfile for a test application. For this example, we will create a very basic Python app that echoes a simple message:\n\n```\n# Dockerfile\nFROM python:3.9-slim\nCOPY hello.py /app/hello.py\nENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"/app/spcs_demo_app.py\"]\n```\n\nAnd spcs\\_demo\\_app.py:\n\n```\nprint(\"Hello from Snowpark Container Services (SPCS) !!!!\")\n```\n\nDOCKERFILE and Python script content – Snowflake Snowpark Container Services\n\nBuild and run it locally:\n\n```\ndocker build -t spcs_demo_app-app:latest .\ndocker run --rm spcs_demo_app-app:latest\n```\n\nBuilding and Running Docker image locally for testing – Snowpark Container Services\n\nIf this runs correctly, you’ve got a working container image.\n\n### **Step 10** —Tag and Push the Container Image\n\nNow tag the image for the Snowflake registry and push it. Suppose your org/account is `<myorg-myacct>` , your database is `spcs_demo_db` , schema public and repository `spcs_demo_repo` . Do:\n\n```\ndocker tag spcs_demo_app-app:latest \n\t<myorg-myacct>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/spcs_demo_db/public/spcs_demo_repo/spcs_demo_app-app:latest\n\ndocker push <myorg-myacct>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/spcs_demo_db/public/spcs_demo_repo/spcs_demo_app-app:latest\n```\n\nTagging Docker image for Snowflake registry – Snowflake Snowpark Container Services\n\nDocker will upload the image layers to Snowflake’s registry. (Behind the scenes, Snowflake stores it in a Stage).\n\nThere’s no visible “ **registry UI** ”, but you can verify from Snowflake:\n\n```\nSHOW IMAGES IN IMAGE REPOSITORY spcs_demo_repo;\n```\n\nThis should list your pushed image ( `<app>:latest` ) and a digest. (Keep track of the image name and tag for the next step).\n\nListing images in spcs\\_demo\\_repo repository – Snowflake Snowpark Container Services\n\n### **Step 11** —Define the Service Specification (YAML)\n\nNow that we have image in place, let’s write a service specification that tells Snowflake how to run it. In Snowpark Container Services, services are defined using YAML files. These YAML files set up all the necessary parameters and configurations required to run the containers within your Snowflake account. While these YAML files support a [wide range of configurable parameters](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/specification-reference) , we will only cover a subset of them here.\n\nFor our example, say we want one container (port 80) and expose it on endpoint spcs-demo-endpoint. A minimal spec might be:\n\n```\nspec:\n\t containers:\n\t- name: spcs\n\t\timage: <myorg-myacct>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/spcs_demo_db/public/spcs_demo_repo/spcs_demo_app-app:latest\n\t\t ports:\n\t\t\t - containerPort: 80\n\t\tenv:\n\t\t\t- name: SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE\n\t\t\t\t value: spcs_demo_wh\n\tendpoints:\n\t- name: spcs-demo-endpoint\n\t\tport: 80\n\t\tpublic: true\n```\n\nSave this to a local file, `service_spec.yaml` . Here’s what it says:\n\n* Under containers, we define a container named hello using our image. We list its ports so Snowflake knows it listens on port 80. We set an environment variable `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` , which in this case tells the container which Snowflake warehouse to use (Snowflake injects all the credentials automatically).\n* Under endpoints, we create spcs-demo-endpoint on port 80 and mark it public: true so external clients can reach it. (If you don’t need external access, omit or set public: false).\n\nYou could add a readinessProbe or commands, but for a simple container, this is enough.\n\n> For reference, check out [Snowflake’s docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services) .\n> \n> \n\nNow that the service\\_spec file is updated, we need to push it to our Snowflake Stage so that we can reference it next in our create service statement. We will use SnowCLI to push the YAML file.\n\nTo do so:\n\n```\ncd <path>\n\nsnow stage copy ./service_spec.yaml @specs --overwrite --connection spec\n```\n\nUploading YAML spec to Snowflake stage via SnowCLI – Snowpark Container Services\n\nNow, let’s verify that our YAML was pushed successfully.\n\n```\nUSE ROLE spcs_role;\nLS @spcs_demo_db.public.specs;\n```\n\nListing files in specs stage for verification – Snowflake Snowpark Container Services\n\n### **Step 12** —Create and Run the Snowflake Service\n\nAfter successfully pushing our image and spec YAML, we will have all the necessary components uploaded to Snowflake to create our service. To create the service, you need three key components: a service name, a Snowflake compute pool for the service to run on and the spec file that defines the service. Use the following SQL to execute it:\n\n```\nCREATE SERVICE spcs_demo_service\n\t IN COMPUTE POOL spcs_compute_pool\n\tFROM @spcs\n\tSPECIFICATION_FILE = 'service_spec.yaml';\n```\n\nThis command registers your service with the name spcs\\_demo\\_service. Snowflake pulls the image, starts one container on the Snowflake compute pool node and exposes the spcs-demo-endpoint.\n\nCheck it with:\n\n```\nSHOW SERVICES \nDESCRIBE SERVICE spcs_demo_service;\n```\n\nYou should see the service in status **`RUNNING`** . If you made it public, you can invoke it from outside (Snowflake provides a DNS name or you can use CALL [SYSTEM$GET\\_SERVICE\\_LOGS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_get_service_logs) to find endpoints). For a quick test, use SnowSQL or Snowsight:\n\n```\nSELECT SYSTEM$GET_SERVICE_LOGS('spcs_demo_service');\n```\n\nOr simply do:\n\n```\nSELECT spcs_demo_service.spcs_demo_app()\n```\n\nNote that your container runs continuously. You can stop it with `ALTER SERVICE spcs_demo_service STOP;` if needed.\n\n### **Optional:** Beyond Services—Jobs and Functions (Optional)\n\nOnce you have a service running, you can also use Snowpark Container Services for batch jobs and UDF-style calls.\n\n#### **1) Snowflake Job Services**\n\nIf, instead of a long-running service you want to run a one-time job, use Snowflake [EXECUTE JOB SERVICE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service) .\n\n```\nEXECUTE JOB SERVICE\n\t IN COMPUTE POOL spcs_compute_pool\n\tNAME = example_job\n\tFROM SPECIFICATION $$\n\t spec:\n\t\tcontainers:\n\t\t - name: worker\n\t\t\t image: <myorg-myacct>.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/spcs_demo_db/public/spcs_demo_repo/spcs_demo_app-app:latest\n\t\t\tenv:\n\t\t\t\tSNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE: spec_demo_wh\n\t\t\t args:\n\t\t\t- \"--do-something\"\t$$;\n```\n\nThis spins up the container, runs it with the given args and waits for it to finish. Snowflake treats each Snowflake `EXECUTE JOB SERVICE` as a new job instance. You can add REPLICAS = N to run multiple instances in parallel. After completion, check job status with `DESCRIBE SERVICE example_job;` or query `SPCS_GET_EVENTS()` .\n\n#### **2) Snowflake Service Functions**\n\nYou can call a service from SQL by creating a UDF that points to the service’s endpoint. For example, if you have an endpoint /echo in your container, you could do:\n\n```\nCREATE FUNCTION my_echo_udf(text VARCHAR)\n\t RETURNS VARCHAR\n\tSERVICE = spcs_demo_service\n\t ENDPOINT = spcs-demo-endpoint\n\tAS '/echo';\n\nSELECT my_echo_udf('Snowpark Container Services!') as response;\n```\n\nThis makes Snowflake issue an HTTP POST to the container’s /echo path, passing “Snowpark Container Services!” and return the result into SQL. Under the hood, Snowflake streams table data to your service as JSON.\n\nThat covers the basics. You now have a working service (or job) running as a container on Snowflake.\n\n* * *\n\n## Snowpark Container Services Cost Breakdown\n\nSnowpark Container Services costs come from three buckets (storage, Snowflake compute pool usage and data transfer) just like the rest of Snowflake.\n\n### Cost Categories in Snowpark Container Services\n\nSnowflake formally divides Snowpark Container Services costs into storage, compute and data transfer.\n\n* **Storage costs** : This includes any Snowflake storage you use (tables or stages) plus optional block storage for volumes or snapshots.\n* **Compute pool costs** : Snowpark Container Services runs your containers on compute pools – essentially clusters of VMs. You pay credits based on the number and size of those nodes. That rate depends on the instance “family” you choose (CPU vs high-memory vs GPU) and runs by the hour.\n* **Data transfer costs** : Moving data in or out of Snowflake (ingress/egress) follows Snowflake’s standard rates. Snowflake also charges a small fee for data moving between compute in the same region (we’ll detail that).\n\n### Snowpark Container Services **Compute Pool Costs**\n\nCompute pool is a cluster of one or more nodes running your containers. Each node is an instance with a fixed vCPU/memory profile. Snowflake assigns a **credit rate per hour** to each instance type. To get dollars per hour, multiply the credits by your Snowflake edition’s price-per-credit. On-demand credits are:\n\n* **~$2** each in Standard US East;\n* **~$3** in Enterprise;\n* **~$4** in Business Critical;\n\nSnowpark Container Services offers several instance families.\n\n* **CPU instances (X64)** – general-purpose. ( `XS` , `S` , `M` , `SL` , `L` sizes.)\n* **High-Memory CPU** – more RAM for each CPU ( `S` , `M` , `SL` , `L` ).\n* **GPU instances** – for GPU-accelerated workloads (NVIDIA-based families like `NV_XS` , `NV_S` , `NV_SM` , `NV_L` , `NV_2M` , `NV_3M` , plus `Google L4/A100` variants).\n\nEach has a fixed credits-per-hour rate. From [Snowflake’s consumption tables](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) .\n\n**➥ CPU\\_X64 (standard CPU)**\n\nSnowflake Credit Table for Snowflake Snowpark Container Service Compute, CPU\n\n**➥ HIGHMEM\\_X64 (high-memory CPU)**\n\nSnowflake Credit Table for Snowflake Snowpark Container Service Compute, High-Memory\n\n**➥ GPU\\_NV (NVIDIA GPU & GCP)**\n\nSnowflake Credit Table for Snowflake Snowpark Container Service Compute, GPU Snowflake Credit Table for Snowflake Snowpark Container Service Compute, GPU\n\n_Example:_\n\n**Standard Plan (US-East, $2/credit):**\n\n* **CPU\\_X64\\_XS** : 0.06 × $2 = **$0.12/hour**\n* **CPU\\_X64\\_L:** 0\\.83 × $2 = **$1.66/hour**\n* **HIGHMEM\\_X64\\_S (Small High-Memory):** 0\\.28 × $2 = **$0.56/hour**\n* **HIGHMEM\\_X64\\_L (Large High-Memory):** 4\\.44 × $2 = **$8.88/hour**\n\n**GPU Instances:**\n\n* **NV\\_XS (NVIDIA T4, Tiny)** : 0.25 × $2 = **$0.50/hour**\n* **NV\\_L (NVIDIA A100, Large)** : 14.12 × $2 = **$28.24/hour**\n\n**Note for Enterprise or Business Critical Editions:** Replace the $2/credit rate with **$3 (Enterprise)** or **$4 (Business Critical)** and recalculate the hourly costs.\n\n**Bigger nodes burn credits faster** . There’s also a small startup penalty: when a compute pool starts or resumes, Snowflake bills at least 5 minutes of credits up-front, then charges by the second thereafter. And note: you are charged for a pool as long as it’s active (even if idle) so it’s wise to configure AUTO\\_SUSPEND to shut nodes off when they’re not needed.\n\n### Snowpark Container Services Storage and Volume Costs\n\nSnowpark Containers Service use standard Snowflake storage plus optional block storage.\n\n**➥ Snowflake stage/table storage**\n\nAnything you store in a Snowflake stage or table (including container images or logs) is billed at Snowflake’s normal storage rate. In US-East (Northern Virginia), standard storage is about **$23 per TB per month** (on-demand). (Rates vary by region; for example in Zurich it’s **~$30 per TB per month** ). In short, _standard Snowflake data storage costs apply_ . So if you have 1 TB of images in a stage, expect roughly **$23/month** in that region.\n\n**➥ Image repository**\n\nSnowpark Container Services uses a Snowflake-managed stage as the container image registry. That means your container images live in a Snowflake stage and incur normal stage storage fees. There’s no special discount or charge – it’s just paid as regular stage storage.\n\n**➥ Logs**\n\nIf you configure services to store local container logs in Snowflake tables (so-called _event tables_ ), that data simply counts as table storage. You pay the usual storage rate on those logs.\n\n**➥ Volume mounts**\n\nSnowpark lets you mount volumes into containers. If you mount a **Snowflake stage as a volume** , again you pay stage costs as above. If you mount the Snowflake **compute pool’s local storage** as a volume, there’s _no extra charge_ beyond the compute node cost. It’s “free” in the sense that you’ve already paid for the node’s cost.\n\n**Block storage (persistent volumes)**\n\nIf you want persistent disk beyond ephemeral, Snowpark Containers Service offers block storage volumes (backed by cloud block storage). These are metered in four ways: **Volume size (TB-month)** , **IOPS usage** , **Throughput** and **Snapshot storage.**\n\nSnowflake Snowpark Container Service Block Storage Pricing\n\nIn summary, for storage: **standard Snowflake storage** **prices apply** for anything on stages or tables. Container-specific extras come from block volumes. Those volumes are fairly expensive (on the order of $82–$100 per TB-month) but give you persistent disk. Don’t forget: all these storage costs run monthly (so divide by ~730 to get a “per hour” sense if needed).\n\nSo, a quick note on storage: if you’ve got data stored on stages or tables, you’ll be charged the standard rates. And if you’re using containers, you’ll also need to pay for block volumes on top of that. Those block volumes are fairly expensive, with a price tag of around **~$82-$100 per terabyte per month** . Just remember, these costs are monthly, so if you’re looking for an hourly breakdown, you can divide by 730 to get an estimate.\n\n### Snowpark Container Services Data Transfer Costs\n\nData transfer (ingress/egress) follows Snowflake’s usual rules, with a small twist for Snowpark Container Services.\n\n**➥ Ingress Cost**\n\n**Ingress (loading data in)** is typically free or included in your storage/compute costs. Snowflake doesn’t charge to upload data into a stage (aside from your cloud provider’s charges, which Snowflake does not bill).\n\n**➥ Egress to Internet or other clouds**\n\nSnowflake charges by the terabyte moved out.\n\n* On AWS, for example, it’s about **$90 per TB to the public internet** (after the first 50 GB which is free in AWS accounts).\n* On Azure, the outbound internet rate is about **$87.50/TB** .\n* Cross-cloud egress (from AWS Snowflake to Azure) is typically **$90–$120/TB** on each end.\n\n**➥ Intra-cloud (same cloud) transfers**\n\nMoving data between regions or within the same cloud has its own rates.\n\n* On AWS, Snowflake does **not** charge for data transfer within the same region (aside from a special SPCS fee, see below).\n* Transfer to a different AWS region is about **$20/TB** .\n* On Azure, inter-region (same continent) is **~$20/TB** , cross-continent up to **~$50/TB** .\n\n**➥ Snowpark Container Services internal data transfer**\n\nWhen containers move data between compute (within Snowflake), Snowflake applies a nominal fee _even if staying in the same region_ . On AWS, Snowpark Container Services data transfers in the same region cost ~ **$3.07 per TB** . It’s a small fee to account for internal network traffic. Also note that, Snowflake _caps_ these SPCS transfer fees: any given day, your SPCS data transfer charge will be reduced by up to 10% of that day’s compute cost. In effect, you never pay SPCS transfer that exceeds 10% of compute spend, which keeps it modest.\n\nSnowflake Snowpark Container Service Data Transfer Cost, AWS Snowflake Snowpark Container Service Data Transfer Cost, Azure Snowflake Snowpark Container Service Data Transfer Cost, GCP\n\nThe true cost of Snowpark Container Services is a sum of all these. Snowflake also provides ACCOUNT\\_USAGE views (like [SNOWPARK\\_CONTAINER\\_SERVICES\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/snowpark_container_services_history) ) so you can query exactly how many credits each pool used. It also shows you any Snowpark Container Services block storage usage and data transfer costs.\n\n* * *\n\n## Quick Tips and Best Practices\n\n### 1) Check your nodes\n\nChoose the smallest instance family that meets your needs.\n\n* For light workloads or dev testing, CPU\\_X64\\_XS (1 vCPU, 6 GiB) or S (3 vCPUs) will cost less.\n* For heavy parallel tasks, larger families or GPUs may be worth it.\n\nAlways make sure to check the instance family table to see vCPU, memory and node limits. Remember each family has a max-node limit (XS family allows up to 50 nodes, GPUs often max at 10 nodes).\n\n### 2) Auto-suspend to save credits\n\nSet [AUTO\\_SUSPEND\\_SECS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool) on your pool (and consider AUTO\\_RESUME=TRUE) so that it doesn’t burn credits when idle. Just keep in mind that it takes a bit of time and credits to start nodes back up. You pay for them in the STARTING state. Usually, it’s a good idea to suspend the pool after a few minutes of inactivity. This way, you avoid wasting credits, but you won’t have to wait too long for it to start back up.\n\n### 3) Manage scaling carefully\n\nIf you’re dealing with variable loads, bump up MAX\\_NODES, but keep MIN\\_NODES on the low side. For services that require low latency, you might keep MIN\\_NODES=1 or more can help with responsiveness. When it comes to batch jobs, you can set REPLICAS to process in parallel but make sure your pool MAX\\_NODES can accommodate it. Monitor usage with [SHOW COMPUTE POOLS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-compute-pools) and metrics from CloudWatch or Stackdriver if you’re on AWS or GCP.\n\n### 4) Network and security\n\nUse Snowflake’s roles and network policies to lock things down. For public services, only bind endpoints if needed. Always make sure to use a separate service role for each application, so you can revoke access easily. Be very careful of Snowflake’s default outbound block, only open egress when absolutely necessary (via EAI).\n\n### 5) Secure Your Secrets\n\n**DO NOT add your secrets into your image.** Use Snowflake secrets integration. Store any API keys or passwords in Snowflake Secret objects and reference them in your service spec under containers.secrets. This injects the secret into the container (as an env var or file) without exposing it in code or image.\n\n### 6) Monitoring and logs\n\nMake use of Snowflake’s built-in tables and functions for Snowpark Container Services. The views/functions like [SPCS\\_GET\\_EVENTS](https://docs.snowflake.cn/sql-reference/functions/spcs_get_events) , [SPCS\\_GET\\_LOGS](https://docs.snowflake.cn/sql-reference/functions/spcs_get_logs) and [SPCS\\_GET\\_METRICS](https://docs.snowflake.cn/sql-reference/functions/spcs_get_metrics) let you query service metrics and logs\n\n### 7) Test incrementally\n\nStart with a simple service (one container, no autoscaling) and confirm it works before adding more complexity.\n\n### 8) Always Clean up\n\nIf you run out of pool credits, you can ALTER COMPUTE POOL … SUSPEND; to stop everything. Or DROP SERVICE when done. Be very careful that services consume resources until stopped.\n\n### 10) Container Networking (private connectivity)\n\nFor enterprise use, consider using Snowflake’s PrivateLink or Private Connectivity features. Snowflake now supports AWS and Azure PrivateLink for SPCS, letting containers access Snowflake without public internet.\n\nNow that you’ve got the complete details on Snowpark Container Services, you’re all set to start using it. You know the basics of setting it up and when to use it. Happy containerizing!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnd that’s a wrap! Snowpark Container Services lets you run your containers inside Snowflake, so your code and data stay together under one security and governance umbrella. It’s essentially a “data-center-less” or “serverless” version of Kubernetes. Now that you’ve thoroughly followed the steps above, you can now easily push images and run microservices, APIs, or ML inference without having to copy huge amounts of data to external storage. No more jumping between different platforms and environments or worrying about moving massive datasets. Snowpark Container Services has you covered.\n\nIn this article, we have covered:\n\n* What is Snowpark Container Services?\n* How Snowpark Container Services Works (Architecture & Core Components)\n* Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Snowpark Container Services\n* Snowpark Container Services Cost Breakdown\n* Quick Tips and Best Practices\n\n… and so much more!\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n**What is the difference between Snowflake and Snowpark?**\n\nSnowflake is the overall cloud data platform (storage + compute + services). **Snowpark** is Snowflake’s developer framework (libraries and APIs) for running custom code inside Snowflake. _Snowpark Container Services_ is a feature of Snowpark that allows full Docker containers in the platform, extending beyond SQL or DataFrame UDFs.\n\n**What is Snowpark Container Services?**\n\nSnowpark Container Services (SPCS) is a fully managed container runtime within Snowflake that lets you deploy and scale containerized applications without moving data. It provides compute pools, image registries and container orchestration while maintaining Snowflake’s security and governance model.\n\n**Do I need a separate cloud account (AWS/GCP/Azure) to use Snowpark Container Services?**\n\nNo, Snowpark Container Services runs entirely within your existing Snowflake account. You don’t need AWS, Azure, or GCP accounts to use Snowpark Container Services. Snowflake manages all the underlying cloud infrastructure.\n\n**How is Snowpark Container Services different from running containers on Kubernetes or EC2?**\n\nSnowpark Container Services is like a “serverless Kubernetes” for Snowflake. You don’t manage the control plane, pods, or networking. Snowflake does all of that. This makes it simpler and more secure for Snowflake-centric workloads. On Kubernetes or EC2, you would set up VPCs, clusters and manage scaling yourself. With SPCS, you only specify the desired compute (pool size) and Snowflake handles the orchestration. The main limitation is less flexibility: you can’t run arbitrary OS tasks outside of containers and you’re limited to Snowflake’s supported instance types and regions. But the big advantage is data locality and built-in Snowflake security.\n\n**Which Snowflake editions support Snowpark Container Services?**\n\nSnowpark Container Services is available on all paid Snowflake editions in commercial regions. It is not available on trial or free-tier accounts.  In 2024 it launched on AWS, then Azure GA (Feb 2025) and Google Cloud GA (Aug 2025). So if you have a standard Enterprise or Business Critical account (non-trial) on AWS, Azure, or GCP, you should have SPCS.\n\n**What is a compute pool and how to size it?**\n\nSnowflake compute pool is a collection of virtual machine nodes that run your containers. You can size it up based on your workload’s CPU, memory and GPU requirements. Start with CPU\\_X64\\_S instances and scale up based on actual resource utilization rather than over-provisioning from the start.\n\n**Does Snowflake charge for idle containers?**\n\nSnowflake charges for the Snowflake **compute pool** nodes, not individual containers. Any node that exists in IDLE or ACTIVE state costs Snowflake credits. So if you have 2 nodes idling (no container processing), you still pay for them. But, you can configure the pool to auto-suspend (eliminating all nodes) after inactivity. Whenever you suspend it, there are no nodes and you aren’t charged.\n\nSo, if your pool is up (even idle) you pay; if it’s fully suspended, you don’t.\n\n**How do containers access Snowflake data?**\n\nInside your container, you typically use Snowflake’s client libraries (Snowpark, Python Connector, JDBC, …) just as you would externally. Snowflake automatically provides temporary credentials to the container under the role that owns the service. That lets your container call snowflake.cursor() or snowpark.session to run queries. You can query tables, load from a stage, or write results back.\n\n**Can I mount Snowflake stages as volumes in Snowpark Container Services?**\n\nYes. Snowflake supports mounting stages as virtual volumes inside a container. When you do this, the data in the stage is available as files/directories. (Under the hood, this uses Snowflake storage and block volumes). You pay standard Snowflake storage rates for that data. The cost is just stage storage; there’s no separate container volume charge.\n\n**How do I give containers internet access?**\n\nOutbound internet is **disabled** for Snowflake containers (for security). To allow outbound calls, set up a Snowflake External Access Integration (EAI) with allowed network rules pointing to those domains or IPs.\n\n**Are container images private or public?**\n\nSnowflake image registry is **private to your account** . You must authenticate with your Snowflake credentials (or token) to docker pull or docker push. Only roles/users you grant access to the repository can read it. There are no public repositories (like Docker Hub) inside SPCS. If you want to use a public base image, Snowflake behind the scenes pulls it from Docker Hub when you build locally, but when you push to Snowflake, only your Snowflake repo is used.\n\n**Can I run multiple containers per service?**\n\nYes. A single service specification can define multiple containers, but more commonly you run multiple _instances_ (replicas) of the same container.\n\n**What’s the difference between a service and a job service?**\n\nA **Service** is long-lived (like a web server). Snowflake will keep it running forever until you stop it. If a container crashes or node restarts, Snowflake restarts it. You create it with CREATE SERVICE. A **job service** (or just “job”) is temporary work. You start it with Snowflake EXECUTE JOB SERVICE and Snowflake runs the container(s) until they exit on their own, then it stops.\n\n**How do I secure secrets and credentials inside containers?**\n\nDO NOT insert secrets into the Docker image. Instead, use Snowflake’s Secret objects and the service spec’s containers.secrets feature. As Snowflake docs explain, you can first [CREATE SECRET](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-secret) (to store, say, an API key). Then in your YAML spec under the container, add:\n\n```\ncontainers:\n- name: main\n\t image: ...\n\t secrets:\n\t - name: MY_SECRET \n\t\t object_type: 'SECRET'\n\t\tobject_name: 'SNOWFLAKE_SECRET'\n....\n```\n\n**How do I roll back to a previous image in Snowpark Container Services?**\n\nSnowpark Container Services doesn’t have a one-click rollback feature, but you can revert by re-deploying the service with an older image tag.\n\nRelated posts:\n\n* [Kubernetes pods vs containers: 4 key differences and how they work together](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/kubernetes-architecture-kubernetes-pods-vs-containers-4-key-differences-and-how-they-work-together/ \"Kubernetes pods vs containers: 4 key differences and how they work together\")\n* [AWS cost optimization tools and tips: Ultimate guide [2025]](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/aws-cost-optimization-8-tools-and-tips-to-reduce-your-cloud-costs/ \"AWS cost optimization tools and tips: Ultimate guide [2025]\")\n* [Optimize cloud costs: Using automation to avoid waste](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/optimize-cloud-costs-using-automation-to-avoid-waste/ \"Optimize cloud costs: Using automation to avoid waste\")\n* [FinOps for AI: Governing the unique economics of intelligent workloads](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/finops-for-ai-governing-the-unique-economics-of-intelligent-workloads/ \"FinOps for AI: Governing the unique economics of intelligent workloads\")\n* [The practical FinOps roadmap series: What to do before you start practicing FinOps (1/4)](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/the-practical-finops-roadmap-series-what-to-do-before-you-start-practicing-finops-1-4/ \"The practical FinOps roadmap series: What to do before you start practicing FinOps (1/4)\")\n\n### Want to know more?\n\nTechnology is evolving rapidly—and it's important to stay on top of the latest trends and critical insights.

It involves establishing principles, gaining visibility into\nspending, implementing controls, and continuously optimizing resources\nto align cloud costs with business value. This pillar is essential for\nfinancial stakeholders, cloud architects, and engineering teams seeking\nto maximize return on investment in cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Principles\n\n#### Business impact: Align cost with business value\n\nConnect cloud spending directly to business outcomes, ensuring that every dollar spent in the cloud contributes meaningfully to strategic objectives and demonstrable value. Embed cost considerations directly into platform planning and architecture considerations.\n\n#### Visibility: Understand & contextualize your consumption footprint\n\nYou can neither control nor optimize what you can't see. Gain deep and granular insight into all aspects of your cloud spending, fostering transparency, and attributing costs effectively.\n\n#### Control: Establish guardrails and governance\n\nEstablish policies and mechanisms to govern resource provisioning and consumption, preventing unnecessary costs and enforcing financial boundaries.\n\n#### Optimize: Maximize efficiency and value\n\nContinuously improve the efficiency of your resources and workloads to maximize the value derived from your platform investment.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThe following key recommendations are covered within each principle of\nCost Optimization:\n\n* **Business Impact**\n  \n    + **Consider cost as a design constraint:** Integrate cost\n        considerations into the architecture and design process from the\n        very beginning, making it a key non-functional requirement alongside\n        performance, security, and reliability.\n    + **Quantify value:** Develop metrics to quantify the business value\n        delivered by cloud resources (e.g., revenue per Snowflake Credit,\n        cost per customer, efficiency gains).\n    + **Trade-off analysis:** Understand the inherent trade-offs between\n        cost, performance, reliability, and security, and make informed\n        decisions that align with business priorities.\n    + **Measure business value KPIs baseline:** Once metrics to quantify\n        business value are identified and trade-offs between cost,\n        performance, and reliability are established, you need to document a\n        “baseline measurement” in order to track progress again.\n        Furthermore, you should establish a regular cadence for refreshing\n        this measurement to ensure value realization is in line with\n        expectations and business goals.\n* **Visibility**\n  \n    + **Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models:** Review\n        Snowflake’s billing models to align technical and non-technical\n        resources on financial drivers and consumption terminology.\n    + **Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy:** Implement robust and organizationally consistent tagging and\n        labeling strategies across all resources (storage objects,\n        warehouses, accounts, queries) to accurately allocate costs to\n        specific teams, products, or initiatives.\n    + **Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA:** Implement a feedback system to transparently show or charge back\n        cloud costs to relevant business units or teams, increasing\n        accountability.\n    + **Deliver clear, historical consumption insights:** Utilize\n        consistent in-tool visualizations or custom dashboards to monitor\n        consumption and contextualize spend on the platform with unit\n        economics.\n    + **Investigate anomalous consumption activity:** Review anomaly\n        detection to identify unforeseen cost anomalies and investigate\n        cause and effect trends.\n* **Control**\n  \n    + **Proactively monitor all platform usage:** Define and enforce\n        budgets for projects and services, setting soft quotas to limit\n        resource consumption and prevent runaway spending.\n    + **Forecast consumption based on business needs:** Establish a\n        forecast process to project future spend needs based on business and\n        technical needs.\n    + **Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources:** Set up\n        automated checks (e.g., Tasks, query insights) and resource\n        guardrails (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies, resource\n        monitors) to identify unusual usage patterns and potential\n        overspending as they occur.\n    + **Govern resource creation and administration:** Establish clear\n        guidelines and automated processes for provisioning and maintaining\n        resources, ensuring that only necessary and appropriately sized\n        resources are deployed (e.g., warehouse timeout, storage policies,\n        resource monitors).\n* **Optimize**\n  \n    + **Compute workload-aligned provisioning:** Continuously monitor\n        resource health metrics to resize and reconfigure to match actual\n        workload requirements.\n    + **Leverage managed services:** Prioritize fully managed Snowflake\n        services (e.g., Snowpipe, Auto-clustering, [Query Acceleration Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) )\n        to offload operational overhead and often achieve better cost\n        efficiency.\n    + **Data storage types & lifecycle management:** Utilize appropriate\n        storage types and implement appropriate storage configuration to\n        right-size workloads to your storage footprint. Move data to cheaper\n        tiers or delete it when no longer needed.\n    + **Workload & architectural optimization:** Leverage architectural\n        decisions for cost-optimized resource utilization while meeting\n        business needs.\n    + **Limit data transfer:** Move, secure, and back up the appropriate\n        footprint across cloud regions.\n    + **Improve continually:** As new capabilities or usage patterns\n        emerge, establish a consistent testing framework to identify areas\n        for cost efficiency.\n\n## Business Impact\n\n#### Overview\n\nTo maximize organizational outcomes, Snowflake consumption must be\nexplicitly tied to business value. While cost optimization ensures\nefficiency, it does not guarantee that spend is aligned with outcomes\nthat matter to stakeholders. Alignment of business value to cost ensures\nworkloads, pipelines, dashboards, and advanced analytics are\ncontinuously evaluated not only for cost but also for the value they\ndeliver. This approach ensures Snowflake delivers as a strategic\nbusiness platform rather than a technical expense.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nBusiness value to cost alignment represents a maturity step in FinOps on\nSnowflake. By embedding benchmarking, impact analysis, SLA definition,\nusage metrics, ROI measures, and business impact evaluation into daily\noperations, organizations can ensure that Snowflake consumption is\ncontinuously justified, optimized, and communicated in business terms.\nThis elevates the conversation with leadership from cost oversight to\nvalue realization and ensures that Snowflake is understood as a platform\nfor growth, innovation, and competitive advantage.\n\n#### Consider cost as a design constraint\n\nCost-Aware Architecting is the practice of embedding financial\naccountability directly into the design and development of Snowflake\nworkloads. By shifting left—introducing cost considerations early in the\narchitecture lifecycle—organizations ensure that ingestion,\ntransformation, analytics, and distribution workloads are not only\nperformant but also aligned with budget expectations. Many cost overruns\nin Snowflake originate from architectural decisions made without cost\nimplications in mind.\n\nFor example, designing ingestion with sub-second latency when daily\nfreshness is sufficient, or selecting inefficient table designs that\nincrease query scanning. These can lead to disproportionate spend.\nShifting cost awareness into architecture helps prevent inefficiencies\nbefore they occur and reinforces Snowflake’s role as a cost-effective\nenabler of business value.\n\nAt the ingestion layer, best practices include balancing latency versus\ncost by selecting appropriate services (e.g., Snowpipe, Snowpipe\nStreaming, or third-party tools) and choosing the right storage format\n(e.g., native tables, Iceberg). For transformations, design with\nfrequency versus SLA in mind to ensure data freshness matches the\nbusiness need. For analytics, apply schema design best practices such as\nthoughtful clustering key choices and pruning strategies to reduce\nconsumed credits. In distribution, optimize data transfer by monitoring\negress patterns and applying cost-saving practices like the [Snowflake Data Transfer Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) .\n\n#### Quantify value\n\nTo maximize organizational outcomes, Snowflake consumption must be\nexplicitly tied to measurable business value and clearly communicated in\nterms that resonate with stakeholders. Establishing baselines using\nSnowflake’s [Account Usage views](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) creates a reference point, while tracking the current state highlights\ntrends in performance and consumption. Defining explicit goal\nstates—such as reduced cost per decision, improved time-to-market, or\nbroader data access—ties workloads directly to outcomes that matter to\nstakeholders. Outliers that diverge from these goals should be flagged\nfor review and optimization to prevent wasted resources. Best practices\ninclude applying unit economic measures related to your field (e.g. cost\nper terabyte analyzed or cost per fraud case prevented) and publishing\nROI dashboards that continuously link Snowflake consumption to business\noutcomes. By incorporating measurement into daily operations,\norganizations can move the conversation with leadership from cost\noversight to demonstrable value realization, positioning Snowflake as a\nclear enabler of enterprise growth and innovation.\n\n#### Trade-off analysis\n\nDefining SLAs or explicit business needs ensures that Snowflake\nworkloads are aligned with their intended purpose and that consumption\nlevels are justified by business outcomes. Some Snowflake workloads can\nbecome over-engineered or maintained without clear justification. Tying\neach workload to an SLA or business requirement prevents waste and\nensures that investment aligns with value. Before implementation, it is\ncrucial to document and align on the value of meeting an SLA,\nidentifying all stakeholders who rely on the workload. This includes\ndifferentiating between tangible outcomes, such as increased revenue,\nand intangible outcomes, such as compliance or data trust. Efficient\ncustomers use both [Snowflake Resource Monitors](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) and Budgets features to enforce guardrails that ensure workloads remain\nwithin acceptable cost-performance boundaries. All design decisions have\ntrade-offs, and explicitly calling out the expected outcomes leads to\nstreamlined decision-making in the future when outcomes are reviewed.\n\n#### Measure business value KPIs baseline\n\nBenchmarking establishes performance and cost baselines for Snowflake\nworkloads and compares them against internal standards as well as\nperformance and cost results from previous tech solutions. These\nbenchmarks can measure workload efficiency, the adoption of specific\nSnowflake features, and the alignment of workload costs to business\noutcomes. Without benchmarks, organizations lack the context to\ndetermine if their Snowflake consumption is delivering economies of\nscale or value back to the business. Benchmarking allows teams to\nidentify best practices, track improvements over time, and highlight\noutliers that may be driving unnecessary spend or delivering unexpected\nvalue.\n\nBest practices include measuring technical unit economic metrics (e.g.\ncredits per 1K queries, credits per 1 TB scanned), warehouse efficiency\nand utilization by workload type, and business unit economics (e.g.\ncredits per customer acquired, credits per partner onboarded, or credits\nper data product-specific KPIs). This provides a more comprehensive\npicture of consumption in relation to cost and value. Outliers should be\nhighlighted in executive communications as either success stories or\ncautionary examples. Benchmarking should be embedded in a continuous\nimprovement loop, where insights drive action, action improves\nefficiency, and those improvements are effectively measured.\n\n## Visibility\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Snowflake Visibility principle is designed to transform opaque cloud\nspending into actionable insights, fostering financial accountability\nand maximizing business value within your Snowflake environment. It is\nfoundational to the FinOps framework, as you cannot control, optimize,\nor attribute business value to what you cannot see. To effectively\nmanage and optimize cloud costs in Snowflake, it's crucial to align\norganizationally to an accountability structure of spend, gain deep and\ngranular insight into all aspects of your cloud spending, and\ntransparently display it to the appropriate stakeholders to take action.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nImplementing a robust FinOps visibility framework in Snowflake,\nsupported by cross-functional collaboration, enables each business\nfunction to access timely and relevant usage and cost data. This\nempowers them to understand the business impact of their consumption and\ntake prompt action when anomalies arise. To meet this vision, consider\nthe following recommendations based on industry best practices and\nSnowflake's capabilities:\n\n#### Understand Snowflake’s resource billing models\n\nIt is essential to review Snowflake's billing models to align technical\nand non-technical resources on financial drivers and consumption\nterminology. Snowflake's elastic, credit-based consumption model charges\nseparately for compute (Virtual Warehouses, Compute Pools, etc),\nstorage, data transfer, and various serverless features (e.g., Snowpipe,\nAutomatic Clustering, Search Optimization, Replication/Failover, AI\nServices). Understanding the interplay of these billing types ensures\nyou can attribute costs associated with each category’s unique usage\nparameters. High-level categories are below.\n\n* **Compute (Virtual Warehouses, Snowpark Container Services, Openflow):** This is often the most dynamic and largest portion of\n  Snowflake spend. Virtual Warehouses are billed per-second after an\n  initial 60-second minimum when active, with credit consumption\n  directly proportional to warehouse size (e.g., an “X-Small” Gen1\n  warehouse consumes one credit per hour, a 'Small' consumes two credits\n  per hour, doubling with each size increase) while SPCS (via [compute pools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) )\n  are billed for all uptime with a minimum of five minutes. [Openflow](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/cost) is billed per second of runtime with a 60-second minimum.\n* **Storage:** Costs are based on the average monthly compressed data\n  volume stored, including active data, Time Travel (data retention),\n  and Fail-safe (disaster recovery) data. The price per terabyte (TB)\n  varies by cloud provider and region.\n* **Serverless features:** Snowflake Serverless features use resources\n  managed by Snowflake, not the user, which automatically scale to meet\n  the needs of a workload. This allows Snowflake to pass on efficiencies\n  and reduce platform administration while providing increased\n  performance to customers. The cost varies by feature and is outlined\n  in Snowflake’s Credit Consumption Document .\n* **Cloud services layer:** This encompasses essential background\n  services, including query compilation, metadata management,\n  information schema access, access controls, and authentication. Usage\n  for cloud services is only charged if the daily consumption of cloud\n  services exceeds 10% of the daily usage of virtual warehouses.\n* **AI features:** Snowflake additionally offers artificial intelligence\n  features that run on Snowflake-managed compute resources, including\n  Cortex AISQL functions (e.g. COMPLETE, CLASSIFY, etc.), Cortex\n  Analyst, Cortex Search, Fine Tuning, and Document AI. The usage of\n  these features, often with tokens, are converted to credits to unify\n  with the rest of Snowflake’s billing model. Details are listed in the\n  Credit Consumption Document.\n* **Data transfer:** Data transfer is the process of moving data into\n  (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake. This generally happens via\n  egress on cross-region [data replication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-cost) , [copying into/out of stage, function calls](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/cost-understanding-data-transfer) ,\n  and cross/same region [SPCS data transfer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) .\n  Depending on the cloud provider and the region used during data\n  transfer, charges vary.\n* **Data sharing & rebates:** Snowflake offers an opt-out Data\n  Collaboration rebate program that allows customers to offset credits\n  by data consumed with shared outside organizations. This rebate is\n  proportional to the consumption of your shared data by consumer\n  Snowflake accounts. See the latest terms and more details here .\n\n#### Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\n\nImplementing robust and organizationally consistent tagging and labeling\nstrategies across all resources (e.g. storage objects, warehouses,\naccounts, queries) is crucial to accurately allocate costs to specific\nteams, products, or initiatives and linking actions to outcomes.\n\n**Tagging in Snowflake**\n\nTagging can be done at several levels:\n\n* **Snowflake object tagging:** Snowflake allows you to apply [object-level tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/introduction) (key-value pairs) to accounts, warehouses, databases, schemas, users,\n  tables, and more. These tags are fundamental for apportioning costs\n  across departments, environments (dev, test, prod), projects, or lines\n  of business. Tags can also support [inheritance](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/inheritance) and [propagation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/propagation) ,\n  simplifying tagging across dependent objects. For example, instead of\n  tagging each individual table underneath a schema, tagging the schema\n  will cause all tables to inherit the tag of the schema. This\n  significantly reduces the manual effort required for tagging and\n  ensures that new objects created within a tagged schema or propagated\n  workflow automatically inherit the correct cost attribution. Snowflake\n  strongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\n  to enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG\\_REFERENCESview](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT\\_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\n  WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY and TABLE\\_STORAGE\\_METRICS to allocate usage\n  to relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\n  Snowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\n* **Query tags for granular workload attribution:** [Query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) can be set via session parameters (e.g., ALTER SESSION SET QUERY\\_TAG =\n  'your\\_tag';) or directly within SQL clients or ETL tools. This\n  associates individual queries with specific departments, projects, or\n  applications, even when using shared warehouses. This is extremely\n  valuable for shared warehouses where multiple teams or applications\n  use the same compute resource, allowing for granular showback. It is\n  also easy to programmatically make changes to query tags within\n  scripts or processes to allocate costs appropriately. Query tags can\n  be found in the QUERY\\_HISTORY view of the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT\\_USAGE\n  schema.\n\n**Tagging models**\n\nIn the initial setup of a business unit or use case, it is important to\nconsider the [model for tagging](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) costs within the platform via shared or dedicated resources. These fall\ninto three large buckets:\n\n* **Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate warehouses with a\n  department. You can use object tags to attribute the costs incurred by\n  those warehouses to that department entirely.\n* **Resources shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of\n  this is a warehouse shared by users from different departments. In\n  this case, you use object tags to associate each user with a\n  department. The costs of queries are attributed to the users. Using\n  the object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by\n  department.\n* **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\n  queries on behalf of its users. In this case, each query executed by\n  the application is [assigned a query tag](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-session) that identifies the team or cost center of the user for whom the query\n  is being made.\n\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits. Review each model before deploying resources. If an\norganization is caught between models, a common approach is to start in\na shared resource environment and graduate to dedicated resources as the\nworkload increases.\n\n**Tag enforcement**\n\nClear and consistent naming conventions for accounts, warehouses,\ndatabases, schemas, and tables facilitate immediate cost understanding.\nEnforcing robust tagging policies (e.g., requiring specific tags for new\nresource creation and using automated scripts to identify untagged\nresources) is crucial for accurate data interpretation and effective\ncost management. Without tag enforcement, it is difficult to accurately\nallocate all costs and can require manual effort, like extensive\ntag-mapping tables. Tag values are enforced within an account, but if a\nmulti-account strategy is needed for your organization, a tag [database can be replicated](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) and leveraged across all accounts to ensure consistent values are used.\nFor best-in-class visibility, it is recommended to have a tagging\nstrategy and tag all resources in an organization to allocate costs to\nrelevant owners.\n\n#### Embed cost accountability into your organization's DNA\n\nTo effectively manage Snowflake spend and align business structure to\ntechnical resources, you should implement a system of showback or\nchargeback. This approach is crucial for promoting accountability and\noptimizing resource usage as there is a single owner for each object\nwithin the platform.\n\n**Showback**\n\nIf cost accountability models have not been implemented previously,\nconsider a showback model. This involves transparently reporting\nSnowflake costs to different departments or projects to raise awareness\nof their costs. By showing each team their monthly consumption (broken\ndown by warehouse usage, query costs, and storage, etc.), it encourages\na cost-conscious culture. This initial step helps teams understand the\nfinancial impact of their actions without the immediate pressure of\nbudget cuts. Tools like Snowflake's built-in [Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) & [budget](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) views, third-party cost management platforms, or custom dashboards can\nbe used to provide these reports.\n\n**Chargeback**\n\nFor more financially mature organizations, a chargeback model can be\nvery effective for managing costs. This system directly bills\ndepartments for their Snowflake usage. This creates a powerful financial\nincentive for teams to optimize their workloads. To make this transition\nsmooth and fair, you need to define clear rules for cost allocation. By\nimplementing chargeback, you turn each department into a financial\nstakeholder, encouraging them to right-size their warehouses, suspend\nthem during idle periods, and write more efficient queries. This shift\nin accountability leads to a more disciplined and cost-effective use of\nyour Snowflake environment.\n\nIn either case, having a centralized dashboard or visual for all\norganizations to review intra-period is critical for financial\naccountability and next-step actions.\n\n#### Deliver clear historical consumption insights\n\nThe most mature FinOps customers are those who programmatically and\nstrategically drive consumption insights across the business. This\ninvolves three core elements:\n\n* **Platform cost tracking:** Pinpoint specific Snowflake credit\n  consumption (compute, storage, serverless, AI, and data transfer),\n  usage patterns, and efficiency opportunities to deconstruct credit\n  usage, understand drivers, identify anomalies, and (eventually) drive\n  forecasting operations.\n* **Normalization of consumption:** Once consumption has been attributed\n  and aggregated to meaningful levels, normalizing it against relevant\n  business and technical metrics contextualizes it in relation to\n  organizational goals. It allows for the natural growth and seasonality\n  of platform usage to be put into context with business and technical\n  demand drivers.\n* **Clear reporting:** Presenting Snowflake cost data in an\n  understandable format for various stakeholders is vital. This enables\n  budgeting, forecasting, KPIs, and business value metrics directly tied\n  to Snowflake credit consumption.\n\n**Track usage data for all platform resources**\n\nTo deliver clear and actionable consumption insights, it is essential to\nleverage the rich usage data that Snowflake natively provides. The\nfoundation for all cost visibility is the **SNOWFLAKE** database, which\ncontains two key schemas for this purpose: [ACCOUNT\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) (for granular, account-level data) and [ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage) (for a consolidated view across all accounts).\n\n|Metric Category |Description |Key Metrics |Primary Data Sources |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Compute & query metrics |Understand the cost of query execution, warehouse consumption, and overall compute health. These are often the most dynamic and largest portion of your spend. |\\- Credits used: total credits by warehouse  \n\\- Query performance: execution time, bytes scanned, compilation time, parameterized query hash  \n\\- Warehouse health: % idle time, queueing, spilling, concurrency |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` (hourly warehouse credit usage)  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` (detailed query metrics and associated warehouses) |\n|Storage metrics |Costs for compressed data, including active data, Time Travel, and Fail‑safe. |\\- Storage volume (avg monthly compressed GB/TB)  \n\\- Inactive storage (Time Travel, Fail‑safe)  \n\\- Storage growth rates  \n\\- Table access (stale/unused) |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS`  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY` |\n|Serverless & AI metrics |Track credit consumption by Snowflake‑managed services and AI features. |\\- Credits used by service  \n\\- Cost per credit‑consuming events |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.<Serverless Feature>_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY`  \n\\- AI views such as `CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_USAGE_HISTORY` , `CORTEX_ANALYST_USAGE_HISTORY` , `DOCUMENT_AI_USAGE_HISTORY` |\n|Data transfer |Cost of moving data into (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake, especially cross‑region/cloud. |\\- Bytes transferred  \n\\- Transfer cost by destination  \n\\- Replication vs. egress |\\- `ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATA_TRANSFER_HISTORY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.DATA_TRANSFER_DAILY_HISTORY` |\n|Financial metrics |Translate credits to currency and provide org‑wide spend view. |\\- Overall dollar spend (daily)  \n\\- Spend by service type |\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY`  \n\\- `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.RATE_SHEET_DAILY` |\n\n**Normalize consumption with unit economic metrics**\n\nFor organizations to achieve comprehensive financial visibility, it is\nrecommended best practice to move beyond tracking aggregate spend and\nimplement Unit Economics Metrics. Unit economics provides a powerful\nmethodology for normalizing cloud consumption by tying platform costs to\nspecific business or operational drivers. This per-unit approach helps\nyou understand cost efficiency, measure the ROI of your initiatives, and\nmake data-driven decisions about resource allocation and optimization.\nBy translating abstract credit consumption into tangible metrics, you\ncan empower technical and business teams with a shared language for\ndiscussing value and cost. These metrics are commonly tracked across\ntime to show changes in efficiency or business impact.\n\n**Efficiency metrics (technical KPIs)**\n\nEfficiency Metrics are technical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that\nconnect cloud costs directly to platform operations and workloads. They\nare crucial for engineering teams and platform owners to identify\ninefficiencies, optimize resource usage, and understand the cost drivers\nof the data platform itself. These metrics provide the granular,\noperational view needed to manage the platform's performance day-to-day.\nSome common examples include:\n\n* **Cost per 1000 executable queries:** Determines the average cost for\n  a batch of one thousand queries. This metric is useful for\n  understanding the overall cost profile of analytical activity on the\n  platform and, when trended, how efficiency has changed across time.\n* **Cost per TB scanned:** Represents the average scanning cost of data.\n  This metric can help understand the cost implications of table\n  configuration (data ordering/clustering keys, Search Optimization) and\n  query efficiency.\n* **Cost per user:** Measures the average cost to support each active\n  user on the platform. This helps in understanding the cost\n  implications of user growth and identifying expensive usage patterns.\n\n> Customers can track credits (warehouse) per thousand queries within a\n> use case to see how efficiency has evolved over time and determine if\n> they are achieving economies of scale.\n> \n> \n\n**Business metrics (business KPIs)**\n\nBusiness Metrics link cloud spending to meaningful business outcomes and\nvalue drivers. These KPIs are essential for executives, finance teams,\nand product managers to understand the return on investment (ROI) of\ncloud expenditure and to allocate costs accurately across different\nparts of the organization. They answer the critical question: \"What\nbusiness value are we getting for our cloud spend?\" Examples include:\n\n* **Cost per customer:** Attributes a portion of the total platform cost\n  to each of the company's end customers. This is a powerful metric for\n  understanding profitability and cost-to-serve at a customer level.\n* **Cost per project:** Allocates cloud costs to specific internal\n  projects, products, or initiatives. This enables accurate\n  project-based accounting and helps assess the financial viability of\n  new features or services.\n* **\"Bring Your Own Metric\":** Custom define unit economic metrics that\n  are unique to your organization's business model. Examples could\n  include Cost per Transaction, Cost per Shipment, or Cost per Ad\n  Impression. Creating these tailored metrics ensures the most accurate\n  alignment between cloud spend and core business value.\n\nIf Snowflake is in the value chain for orders, the cost per order can be a good metric to tie Snowflake consumption to Business Demand Drivers.\n\n**Visualize metrics with Snowsight tools and external BI tools**\n\nA critical component of cost governance is the effective visualization\nof spending and usage data. Raw data, while comprehensive, is often\ndifficult to interpret and act upon. By translating cost and usage\nmetrics into interactive dashboards and reports, you can empower\nstakeholders—from engineers to executives—to understand spending\npatterns, troubleshoot, and make informed decisions. A multi-layered\napproach can be used to track meaningful cost metrics.\n\n* **Snowsight's built-in cost management capabilities:** Snowsight\n  provides pre-built visuals for usage and credit monitoring directly\n  within the [Snowflake Cost Management UI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-exploring-overall) .\n  It allows filtering by tags (e.g., view cost by department tag),\n  credit consumption by object types, and cost insights to optimize the\n  platform.\n* **Creating custom dashboards or Streamlit apps for different stakeholder groups:** Snowsight facilitates the creation of custom\n  dashboards using ACCOUNT\\_USAGE and ORGANIZATION\\_USAGE views. Custom\n  charts in the Dashboards feature and Streamlit apps can both be easily\n  shared. Combined with cost allocation and tagging, this allows for\n  tailored views for finance managers (aggregated spend), engineering\n  managers (warehouse utilization), or data analysts (query\n  performance).\n* **Integrating with third-party BI tools for advanced analytics:** Connecting to Snowflake from tools like Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or\n  custom applications offers highly customizable and extensive control\n  over cost data visualization. Cloud-specific third-party data programs\n  (FinOps platforms) offer easier setup and more out-of-the-box\n  Snowflake cost optimization insights.\n* **Leverage Cortex Code (In Preview):** This AI Assistant capability\n  allows users to query cost and usage data in ACCOUNT\\_USAGE views using\n  natural language natively in the Snowsight UI.\n\n#### Investigate anomalous consumption activity\n\nCost Anomaly Detection is a critical component of visibility that\nleverages machine learning to continuously monitor credit consumption\nagainst historical spending patterns, automatically flagging significant\ndeviations from the established baseline. This proactive monitoring is\nessential for preventing budget overruns and identifying inefficiencies,\nshifting the organization from a reactive to a proactive cost management\nposture to mitigate financial risk. As a best practice, you should\ninitially review anomaly detection on the entire account to gain a broad\nview, then dive deeper into a more granular review for individual\nhigh-spend warehouses. [This approach](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies) allows for more targeted analysis and assigns clear ownership for\ninvestigating any flagged anomalies. There are several methods for\nanomaly detection supported by Snowflake:\n\n**Cost Anomalies in Snowsight**\n\nSnowsight, Snowflake's primary web interface, offers a dedicated Cost\nManagement UI that allows users to visually identify and analyze the\ndetails of any detected cost anomaly. The importance of this intuitive\nvisual interface lies in its ability to make complex cost data\naccessible to a wide range of stakeholders, enabling rapid root cause\nanalysis by correlating a cost spike with specific query history or user\nactivity. One of the tabs in this UI is the Cost Anomaly Detection tab,\nwhich enables you to view cost anomalies at the organization or account\nlevel and explore the top warehouses or accounts driving this change. To\nfoster a culture of cost awareness and accountability, it is a best\npractice to ensure there is an owner for an anomaly detected in the\naccount and set up a [notification (via email)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-ui) in the UI itself to ensure that cost anomalies are quickly and\naccurately investigated.\n\n**Programmatic Cost Anomaly Detection**\n\nFor deeper integration and automation, organizations can review [anomalies programmatically](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-anomalies-class) using the SQL functions and views available within the SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL\nschema. This approach is important for enabling automation and\nscalability, allowing cost governance to be embedded directly into\noperational workflows, such as feeding anomaly data into third-party\nobservability tools or triggering automated incident response playbooks.\nA key best practice is to utilize this programmatic access to build\ncustom reports and dashboards that align with specific financial\nreporting needs and to create advanced, automated alerting mechanisms\nthat pipe anomaly data into established operational channels, such as\nSlack or PagerDuty.\n\n**Custom Anomaly Detection & Notification**\n\nAlthough anomalies are detected at the account and organization level,\nif you desire to detect anomalies at lower levels (e.g. warehouse or\ntable), it is recommended to leverage Snowflake’s [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) ML class and pair it with a Snowflake [alert](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection) to notify owners of more granular anomalies that occur within the\necosystem. This ensures all levels of Snowflake cost can be monitored in\na proactive and effective way. As a best practice, [notifications](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/notifications/about-notifications) should be configured for a targeted distribution list that includes the\nbudget owner, the FinOps team, and the technical lead responsible for\nthe associated Snowflake resources, ensuring all stakeholders are\nimmediately aware of a potential cost overrun and can coordinate a swift\nresponse.\n\n## Control\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Control principle of the Cost Optimization framework is designed to\nmove organizations beyond cost reporting by establishing the necessary\nautomated guardrails and governance policies to manage and secure\nSnowflake consumption proactively. This framework enforces financial\ngovernance by transforming cost visibility into tangible action,\nutilizing features like budgets and resource monitors to prevent\nuncontrolled growth and ensure consumption aligns strictly with\norganizational financial policies. Control is foundational for\nmaximizing the value of the platform by ensuring disciplined and\ncost-effective resource utilization.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nImplementing a comprehensive control framework, supported by features\nsuch as Resource Monitors, Budgets, and Tagging Policies, empowers\norganizations to enforce financial accountability and maintain budget\npredictability. By adopting these controls, teams can actively manage\nspend, quickly and automatically mitigate cost inefficiencies, and\nensure the disciplined, cost-effective utilization of the entire\nSnowflake environment. The culmination of all of these controls leads to\ngreater platform ROI and minimized financial risk. To meet this goal,\nconsider the following recommendations based on industry best practices\nand Snowflake's capabilities:\n\n#### Proactively monitor all platform usage\n\nTo effectively manage and [control Snowflake spend](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling) ,\nit is essential to establish and enforce cost guardrails. Implementing a [budgeting system](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) is a key\nFinOps practice that promotes cost accountability and optimizes resource\nusage by providing teams with visibility into their consumption and the\nability to set alerts and automated actions. Budgeting helps to prevent\nunexpected cost overruns and encourages a cost-conscious culture.\n\n**Set budgets permissions**\n\nTo establish effective budgets, it's crucial to define [roles and privileges](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) by configuring the role, team, or user responsible for the resources.\nThis ensures that budget tracking aligns with specific business units or\nprojects, enabling accurate cost attribution and accountability. By\nlinking consumption to the relevant stakeholders, you can create a clear\nshowback or chargeback model, which is vital for fostering a sense of\nownership over spending. This configuration should be part of a broader,\nconsistent tagging strategy to ensure all costs are properly allocated\nto departments, environments, or projects.\n\n**Create budget categories**\n\nCategorizing costs is fundamental for granular budget management. You\ncan establish budgets based on the [account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/account-budget) or create [custom categories](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/custom-budget) using Object Tags. Custom tags, such as those for a data product or cost\ncenter, are critical for accurately apportioning costs across different\ndepartments, lines of business, or specific projects. This granular\napproach provides a detailed breakdown of where spending occurs,\nenabling more precise control and informed decision-making regarding\nresource allocation. Implementing robust tagging policies and naming\nconventions ensures consistency and facilitates the interpretation of\ncost data. Because budgets are soft limit objects, objects can be part\nof more than one budget if different perspectives need to be tracked for\ncost (e.g., cost center & workload level budgeting).\n\n**Implement a notification strategy**\n\nEffective budget management relies on timely communication. Setting up\nalerting through emails or webhooks to collaboration tools like Slack\nand Microsoft Teams provides proactive [notification](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/notifications) to key stakeholders when spending approaches or exceeds a defined\nthreshold. These alerts provide teams with an opportunity to review and\nadjust their usage before it leads to significant cost overruns. This\ncapability positions organizations for security success by mitigating\npotential threats through comprehensive monitoring and detection.\n\nNotifications are not limited to just budgets; [Snowflake alerts](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/alerts) can also be\nconfigured to systematically notify administrators of unusual or costly\npatterns, such as those listed in the Control and Optimize sections of\nthe Cost Pillar. This ensures that key drivers of Snowflake consumption\ncan be tracked and remediated proactively, even as the platform’s usage\ngrows.\n\n#### Forecast consumption based on business needs\n\nForecasting Snowflake consumption should be a strategic business\nfunction, not a mere technical prediction. The goal is to establish a\ntransparent basis for budgeting and optimizing ROI by linking\nconsumption directly to measurable business outcomes. In a dynamic,\nusage-based environment where compute costs are the most volatile\nelement of the bill, a robust framework must integrate quantitative\nanalysis of historical usage with qualitative insights into future\nbusiness drivers. The following framework outlines how to build and\nmaintain a comprehensive consumption forecast.\n\n**Establish the Baseline**\n\nThis phase focuses on understanding the source of spend and establishing\ngranular cost accountability.\n\n* **Identify demand drivers and unit economics:** To understand what\n  drives Snowflake spend, correlate historical credit, storage, and data\n  transfer usage with key business metrics like cost per customer or per\n  transaction. Use Snowflake's [ACCOUNT\\_USAGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage) schema, including the WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY and QUERY\\_HISTORY\n  views, as the primary data sources for this analysis.\n* **Granular cost attribution:** Accurately tie costs back to business\n  teams or workloads by implementing a mandatory tagging strategy for\n  all warehouses and queries. Align these tags with your organization's\n  financial structure to provide clear cost segmentation.\n\n**Build the predictive model**\n\nThis phase integrates historical trends with strategic business inputs\nto create forward-looking projections.\n\n* **Historical trend analysis:** Analyze past usage for trends,\n  seasonality, and outliers to inform future projections. Start with\n  simple trend-based forecasting and progressively move to more\n  sophisticated models, leveraging Snowflake’s built-in [SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECASTfunction](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/forecasting) for time-series forecasting.\n* **Driver-based forecasting:** Integrate planned business initiatives\n  and new projects directly into the model. Collaborate with business\n  leaders to gather strategic inputs such as projected customer growth,\n  new product launches, or increased data ingestion from marketing\n  campaigns.\n* **Scenario modeling:** Develop multiple forecast scenarios (e.g.,\n  \"conservative,\" \"base case,\" \"aggressive\") by applying varied growth\n  factors to key business drivers. This enables flexible planning and\n  helps mitigate financial risk.\n\n**Operationalize and optimize**\n\nThis phase links the forecast to continuous monitoring, governance, and\nproactive cost controls.\n\n* **Continuous monitoring and variance analysis:** Regularly compare\n  actual consumption against the forecast to identify and investigate\n  significant variances. This feedback loop is crucial for refining the\n  underlying model and adapting to evolving business needs.\n* **Collaborative governance:** Ensure a single source of truth for\n  consumption data by establishing a regular FinOps review session with\n  Finance, Engineering, and Business teams. Use customized dashboards to\n  present data in business-friendly terms.\n* **Implement predictive budget controls:** Shift from reactive spending\n  to a proactive model. Utilize Snowflake Resource Monitors and Budgets,\n  which employ monthly-level time-series forecasting, to define credit\n  quotas and trigger automated alerts or suspensions to prevent cost\n  overruns.\n\n#### Enforce cost guardrails for organizational resources\n\nTo effectively manage Snowflake expenditure and prevent unforeseen\ncosts, it is crucial to implement a robust framework of resource\ncontrols. These controls act as automated guardrails, ensuring that\nresource consumption for compute, storage, and other services aligns\nwith your financial governance policies. By proactively setting policies\nand remediating inefficiencies, you can maintain budget predictability\nand maximize the value of your investment in the platform.\n\n**Compute controls**\n\nControlling compute consumption is often the most critical aspect of\nSnowflake cost management, as it typically represents the largest\nportion of spend. Snowflake offers several features to manage warehouse\nusage and prevent excessive costs.\n\n* **Implement resource monitors** : [Resource monitors](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) are a powerful feature for tracking and controlling credit consumption\n  across virtual warehouses or for the entire account. Their primary\n  importance lies in their ability to enforce strict budget limits,\n  preventing cost overruns by automatically [triggering actions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors) ,\n  such as sending notifications and/or suspending warehouses when credit\n  usage reaches a defined quota. For effective governance, it is a best\n  practice to create multiple resource monitors at different\n  granularities (e.g., per-department, per-project) with escalating\n  actions, such as notifying administrators at 80% usage and suspending\n  all assigned warehouses at 100% usage, to cap spending. It is also\n  considered best practice to ensure there is a consistent action tied\n  to the resource monitors based on your organization’s ways of working.\n  For example, it is worth considering that set resource monitors\n  perform actions like notify to specific admin(s) within your\n  organization.\n* **Reduce Runaway Queries:** Runaway or hung queries can lead to\n  significant cost overruns. Managing long-running queries is especially\n  important for environments with ad-hoc users or complex analytical\n  workloads, where a poorly written query can consume credits for hours.\n  \n    + **Statement timeout policies** automatically terminate any query\n        that runs longer than a specified time limit. This serves as an\n        essential guardrail to prevent individual queries from consuming\n        excessive resources and impacting both cost and performance for\n        other users. The best practice is to set the [STATEMENT\\_TIMEOUT\\_IN\\_SECONDSparameter](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling-controls) at different levels—for the account, warehouse, specific users, or\n        individual sessions—to tailor controls to different workload\n        patterns, such as allowing longer timeouts for ETL warehouses\n        compared to BI warehouses. [Queued timeout policies](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling-controls) can also help remove queries that eclipse a reasonable time\n        threshold and could have been run elsewhere by users trying to\n        receive a response.\n    + **Policy-based automation** can also cancel queries pre-emptively.\n        An example is using stored procedures that leverage the [SYSTEM$CANCEL\\_QUERY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_cancel_query) function to terminate statements that exceed predefined runtime\n        thresholds or contain ill-advised logic, such as exploding joins.\n        This approach allows you to more finely customize the types of\n        queries you want to cancel, as you have full control over defining\n        the stored procedure logic.\n* **Auto-suspend policies** : Auto-suspend policies are a foundational\n  cost control for virtual warehouses, automatically suspending a\n  warehouse after a defined period of inactivity. By default, all\n  warehouses have auto-suspend enabled, however this feature can be\n  disabled, so it’s important to [monitor warehouse auto-suspend configuration](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) and ensure proper access controls are set to restrict users from disabling the auto-suspend setting. The best practice for balancing cost versus performance is to reduce the auto-suspend policy to the minimum possible (generally above 60 seconds) without affecting query caching and performance (SLA) expectations.\n\n**Storage Controls**\n\nWhile storage costs are generally lower than compute costs, they can\ngrow significantly over time. Understanding the different components of\nstorage cost and implementing policies to manage the types of storage is\nkey to keeping these costs in check.\n\n* **Staged files:** [Staged](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-stage) files are files that have been prepped for bulk data loading/unloading\n  (stored in compressed or uncompressed format). They can be stored in\n  an [external stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-create-stage) using cloud provider’s blob storage (such as Amazon S3) or an [internal stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-create-stage) within the Snowflake platform. You are only charged for data stored in\n  internal stages.\n  \n+ To help control costs on staged files, as well as improve\n        performance of data loads, you can ensure successfully ingested\n        files are removed by using the PURGE = TRUE option of the [COPY INTO <table>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) command . Alternatively, use the [REMOVE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/remove) command to remove the files in the stage.\n* **Active Storage:** [Active Storage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/info-schema/table_storage_metrics) consists of the data in a table that can be actively queried against\n  at the current point of time (i.e., without using Time-Travel\n  commands) **.** To control active storage costs, you can create a [Storage Lifecyle Policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/storage-lifecycle-policy/storage-lifecycle-policies) to automatically archive or delete data based on an expiration policy\n  you create.\n* **Time Travel:** [Time Travel](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) data is data that is maintained for all historical changes of a table\n  through its retention time, allowing for easy recovery of changed or\n  deleted data.\n  \n    + Time Travel data retention is controlled using the [DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) parameter , which can be set at a number of different object\n        levels (i.e. Account, Database, Schema, Table), so it is important\n        to monitor this setting to ensure you do not have excessive data\n        retention where it is not needed.\n    + Snowflake has a standard [data retention period](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) of one day. This is automatically enabled for all accounts, but for some tables, particularly [large, high churn tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-storage-considerations) , this one day can still result in excessive costs. To reduce costs in these cases, you can create these tables as transient with zero Time Travel retention (i.e., DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS=0) and periodically insert a copy of the table contents into a permanent table.\n* **Fail-safe:** In addition to Time-Travel, Snowflake retains\n  historical data for seven days after the Time-Travel retention period\n  expires as [Fail-Safe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-failsafe) data. This data can be requested for worst-case scenario data\n  recovery. Fail-safe applies to all tables that are created as the\n  permanent [table type](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) (which is the default table type).\n  \n+ However, for ETL or data modeling, it is common to have tables that\n        are created on a short-term basis to support transformations. For\n        these use cases, it is recommended that you use [Temporary and Transient tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-cdp-storage-costs) ,\n        which do not utilize fail-safe storage and thus do not incur\n        additional storage costs.\n* **Retained for clones:** This is data that is stored because it is\n  referenced by a clone, despite the data being deleted or outside the\n  retention period of the base table that was cloned. To control costs\n  related to these “stale” clones, it is recommended that you monitor [RETAINED\\_FOR\\_CLONE\\_BYTES](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-to-manage-RETAINED-FOR-CLONE-BYTES) and drop clones that are no longer needed. You can leverage the [Alerts and Notifications features](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-alerts) to alert you when RETAINED\\_FOR\\_CLONE\\_BYTES exceeds a threshold, prompting you to take action.\n\n**Serverless Features**\n\nFor serverless features, which do not use warehouse compute and\ntherefore cannot leverage the Resource Monitor feature, we recommend\nsetting up a budget. [Budgets](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets) allow\nyou to define a monthly spending limit on the [compute costs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute) for a Snowflake account or a custom group of Snowflake objects. When the\nspending limit is projected to be hit, a notification is sent. While\nBudgets do not explicitly allow you to suspend serverless features upon\nreaching a limit (the way that Resource Monitors do), Budgets can be\nconfigured to not only send emails, but also send [notifications](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/budgets/notifications) to a cloud message queue or other webhooks (such as Microsoft Teams,\nSlack, or PagerDuty). This then gives you the ability to trigger other\nactions for remediation.\n\n#### Govern resource creation and administration\n\nTo prevent uncontrolled spend as organizations scale, it's essential to\nhave a clear management strategy for Snowflake resources, most notably,\nvirtual warehouses. This strategy should encompass a defined\nprovisioning process, ongoing object management, and automated platform\nenforcement to foster agility while maintaining financial discipline.\n\n**Centralized vs. decentralized management**\n\nOrganizations tend to adopt one of two primary approaches to managing\nSnowflake resources:\n\n* **Centralized management:** A dedicated team, such as a platform\n  Center of Excellence (CoE), handles resource creation and\n  administration policies. This ensures consistency, adheres to best\n  practices, and facilitates robust cost control. This model is ideal\n  for large enterprises where strict governance and chargeback are\n  paramount.\n* **Decentralized management:** Individual business units or teams\n  manage their own resources. This provides greater autonomy and speed\n  but can lead to resource sprawl, inconsistent practices, and\n  significant cost inefficiencies if not properly governed.\n\n**Striking the balance: the federated model**\n\nThe most effective strategy often lies in a hybrid, or federated, model.\nThis approach combines centralized governance (policies defined by a\nCoE) with decentralized execution (teams having the freedom to create\nresources within those guardrails). This balance enables agility while\nmitigating financial risk.\n\n**Core Principles for Governance**\n\nRegardless of the chosen model, these principles are essential for\neffective governance:\n\n* **Limit resource creation:** Restrict the ability to create or modify\n  virtual warehouses and other high-cost resources to a small number of\n  trusted roles to prevent uncontrolled growth.\n* **Establish a transparent workflow:** Create a clear, simple workflow\n  for provisioning resources, especially for larger warehouses. For\n  example, any request for a warehouse of medium size or larger should\n  require a business justification and an assigned cost center.\n* **Near real-time visibility:** Triggered visibility is non-negotiable\n  for monitoring resource creation and resizing. Configure alerts that\n  notify FinOps or CoE teams whenever a new warehouse is created or an\n  existing one is modified outside of a provisioning workflow. This\n  allows for immediate review and prevents overprovisioning.\n* **Enforce tagging:** Make a mandatory tagging strategy a prerequisite\n  for all resource creation. This ensures every credit spent can be\n  accurately attributed to the correct department or project, enabling\n  robust chargeback and accountability.\n* **Automate deactivation:** To prevent object sprawl, implement\n  policies that identify and deactivate stale resources after a\n  predetermined period of disuse.\n\n## Optimize\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Optimization principle of the Cost Optimization framework focuses on continuously improving the efficiency of your Snowflake resources. This includes optimizing compute, storage, data transfer, and managed services by understanding their usage and identifying areas for improvement. The frequency of optimization efforts should be guided by the metrics established in the Visibility principle and monitored through the Control principle. All recommendations within this Optimize principle are to be reviewed on a regular cadence and balanced with business and performance needs.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nSnowflake offers numerous optimization controls within its platform.\nThese features are designed to enhance efficiency and reduce\nadministrative overhead for your various workloads. Coupled with\noperational best practices that utilize features in a healthy manner,\nyou can balance performance goals with cost governance requirements to\nmeet business objectives.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you will be able to:\n\n* Reduce administration time\n* Increase workload efficiency\n* Balance cost controls and guardrails to meet service level agreements\n  and business objectives\n* Achieve healthy growth and economies of scale within your organization\n\nTo foster healthy growth and achieve economies of scale within your\norganization, we recommend the following, drawing upon industry best\npractices and Snowflake's capabilities.\n\n#### Compute workload-aligned provisioning\n\nCompute is the most significant part of any organization’s Snowflake\nspend, typically accounting for 80% or more of spend. A good warehouse\ndesign should incorporate the principles below:\n\n* Separate warehouses by workload (e.g., ELT versus analytics versus\n  data science)\n* Workload size in bytes should match the t-shirt size of the warehouse\n  in the majority of the workloads–larger warehouse size doesn’t always\n  mean faster\n* Align warehouse size for optimal cost-performance settings\n* [Utilize Multi-Cluster Warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) configuration to solve for high concurrency\n* Utilize [Query Acceleration Services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) to help with infrequent, large data scans\n* For memory-intensive workloads, use a warehouse type of Snowpark\n  Optimized or higher memory resource constraint configurations as\n  appropriate\n* Set appropriate auto-suspend settings - longer for high cache use,\n  lower for no cache reuse\n* Set appropriate warehouse query timeout settings for the workload and\n  the use cases it supports.\n\nUsing the principles above ensures that your compute costs are well\nmanaged and balanced with optimal benefits.\n\n**Separate warehouses by workload**\n\nDifferent workloads (e.g., data engineering, analytics, AI and\napplications) have varying characteristics. [Separating these to be serviced by different virtual warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) can help ensure relevant features in Snowflake can be utilized.\n\nSome examples of this include:\n\n* Optimize dashboards and reports by [reusing the warehouse SSD cache](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations) for repeated select queries. This can be achieved by configuring a\n  longer warehouse autosuspend setting.\n* Loading large volumes of data using [optimal file sizes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-prepare) and utilizing all available threads in a virtual warehouse\n* Processing large data sets for AI workloads using memory-optimized\n  warehouses\n\n**Warehouse sizing**\n\nMapping the workload to the [right warehouse size](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-warehouse-size) and configuration is an important consideration of warehouse design.\nThis should consider several factors like query completion time,\ncomplexity, data size, query volume, SLAs, queuing, and balancing\noverall cost objectives. Warehouse sizing involves a cost-benefit\nanalysis that balances performance, cost, and human expectations. Humans\noften have expectations that their queries will not be queued or take a\nlong time to complete, so it is recommended to have dedicated warehouses\nfor teams.\n\nRecommendations for choosing the right-sized warehouse include:\n\n* Follow the principles outlined above and understand that this is a\n  continuous improvement process.\n* Choose a size based on the estimated or actual workload size and\n  monitor.\n* Utilize Snowflake's extensive telemetry data, such as [QUERY\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history) and [WAREHOUSE\\_METERING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/warehouse_metering_history) ,\n  to validate that the warehouse size is impacting the metrics you care\n  about in the direction you intend.\n\n**Optimal warehouse settings**\n\nWhile Snowflake strives for minimal knobs and self-managed tuning, there\nare situations where selecting the right settings for warehouses can\nhelp with optimal cost and/or performance. Some of the key [warehouse settings](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse) include\n\n* Auto suspend\n* Multi-cluster settings\n* Warehouse resource constraints\n* Warehouse type\n\nTo maintain an optimal balance between cost and performance, regularly\nmonitor your resource usage (e.g., weekly or monthly) and set up\nresource monitors to alert you to high credit consumption. When workload\ndemands change, adjust your settings as needed.\n\n**Warehouse consolidation**\n\nIf you find yourself with an excess of provisioned warehouses or a shift\nin workloads necessitating consolidation, apply the aforementioned\nprinciples. Begin with the least utilized warehouses and migrate their\nworkloads to an existing warehouse that handles similar tasks.\n\nThe [WAREHOUSE\\_LOAD\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/warehouse_load_history) view can help you assess the average number of queries running on a\nwarehouse over a specific period. A useful benchmark is to aim for a\nwarehouse running queries 80% of the time it's active. Continuously\nmonitor your key metrics to ensure they still meet SLA goals and adjust\nwarehouse settings as needed.\n\n#### Leverage Managed Services\n\nTo achieve significant operational efficiency and predictable costs,\nprioritize the use of serverless and managed services. These services\neliminate the need to manage underlying compute infrastructure, allowing\nyour organization to pay for results rather than resource provisioning\nand scaling. Evaluate the following servterless features to reduce costs\nand enhance performance in your environment.\n\n**Storage optimization**\n\nSnowflake offers several serverless features that automatically [manage and optimize your tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-storage) ,\nreducing the need for manual intervention while improving query\nperformance. The following features ensure your data is efficiently\norganized, allowing for faster and more cost-effective qeuerying without\nthe burden of user management.\n\n**Automatic Clustering** is a background process in Snowflake that\norganizes data within a table by sorting it according to predefined\ncolumns. This process is critical for optimizing query performance and\nreducing costs. Benefits include:\n\n* **Improved query pruning:** By sorting data, automatic clustering\n  enables more effective pruning in SQL WHERE clauses, meaning less data\n  needs to be scanned for a given query.\n* **Faster joins:** Clustering also results in quicker and more\n  efficient join operations.\n* **Cost-efficient queries:** These benefits ultimately result in faster\n  and more cost-effective query execution.\n\n**Considerations and Best Practices:**\n\n* **Careful tuning:** It's essential to tune automatic clustering\n  carefully. Overuse of clustering keys, use of highly selective keys,\n  or frequent data manipulation language (DML) operations can\n  significantly increase clustering costs.\n* **Infrequently queried, frequently updated tables:** Exercise caution\n  with tables that are often updated but rarely queried, as clustering\n  costs may outweigh performance improvements.\n* **Cost estimation:** Before enabling, estimate clustering costs for a\n  table using Snowflake's system function for a preliminary cost/benefit\n  analysis.\n* **Strategic cluster key selection:** Optimizing clustering key\n  selection is vital to strike a balance between cost and performance.\n\n**Search Optimization Service (SOS)** enhances the performance of point\nlookup searches by creating a persistent search access path. Its primary\nvalue lies in achieving better pruning for these specific query types,\nwhich is critical for applications requiring quick response times. They\ncan be used in combination with auto-clustering and [Snowflake Optima service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-optima) .\n\n**Considerations for SOS:**\n\n* **Excessive indexed columns:** Avoid having too many indexed columns,\n  especially on high-churn tables, as maintenance costs can become\n  substantial.\n* **Inefficient cost-benefit ratio:** Tables that are frequently updated\n  but infrequently queried for point lookups can lead to an inefficient\n  cost/benefit ratio.\n* **Cost estimation:** Before enabling, estimate SOS costs on a given\n  table using a Snowflake system function to perform a preliminary\n  cost/benefit analysis. Index selection is crucial for balancing\n  performance and cost, a topic also addressed in the Workload\n  Optimization section.\n\n**Materialized Views (MVs)** are pre-computed query results stored as a\nseparate table and automatically maintained by Snowflake.\n\n**Benefits of MVs:**\n\n* **Cost efficiency:** It is often cheaper to update a materialized view\n  than to repeatedly execute full scans of large, complex base tables.\n* **Alternative table order:** MVs can provide an alternative table\n  order for queries that do not align with your existing clustering\n  design.\n\n**Considerations for MVs:**\n\n* **Infrequently queried, frequently updated tables:** Avoid creating\n  materialized views on tables that are frequently updated but rarely\n  queried, as automated maintenance costs will negate any potential\n  query cost savings.\n* **Clustering differences:** Be aware of clustering differences between\n  the base table and the materialized view, as this can lead to high\n  maintenance costs.\n\n**[Query Acceleration Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service) (QAS):** QAS is a serverless feature that provides a burst of additional\ncompute resources to accelerate specific parts of a query, rather than\nreplacing an appropriately sized warehouse. It's particularly beneficial\nfor large I/O operation queries, eliminating the need to manually scale\nwarehouses up or down. QAS also helps speed up query execution when\ntable clustering cannot be altered due to other workload dependencies. A\ncost-benefit analysis should always be performed to ensure that the\ncredit consumption from QAS is justified by the performance improvement\nand the avoided cost of a larger warehouse.\n\n**Serverless tasks:** Serverless tasks enable the execution of SQL\nstatements or stored procedures on a user-defined schedule, eliminating\nthe need for a user-managed virtual warehouse. This is a cost-effective\nsolution for infrequent workloads where a warm cache offers minimal\nvalue, or for unpredictable workloads that don't utilize a minimum\n60-second usage.\n\n#### Data storage types & lifecycle management\n\nNext to compute, storage often represents the second-highest cost\ncomponent in Snowflake. Effective storage governance is a critical\nconcern for many industries due to federal and global regulations.\nSnowflake's default settings prioritize maximum data protection, which\nmay not always align with the requirements of every workload or\nenvironment. This section focuses on how to manage and configure\nstorage-related settings appropriately, ensuring that storage costs\nremain reasonable and deliver business value.\n\n**Optimizing table volume and auditing usage**\n\n* **Review policy-driven data lifecycle management:**\n  \n    + **Time Travel & Fail-safe:** Set the [DATA\\_RETENTION\\_TIME\\_IN\\_DAYS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters) parameter on a per-table or per-schema basis to the minimum required\n        for your business needs. For transient data, use [TRANSIENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) tables to eliminate Fail-safe costs.\n    + **Retained for clone:** Be mindful of cloning operations. While\n        zero-copy cloning is cost-effective initially, any subsequent DML\n        (Data Manipulation Language) operations on the clone will create new\n        micro-partitions, increasing storage costs. It is recommended to\n        drop clones when they are no longer needed.\n* **Be aware of high-churn tables:**\n  \n+ If a table is updated consistently, inactive storage (Time Travel &\n        Fail-safe data) can grow at a much faster rate than active storage.\n        A high churn table is generally characterized as one that has 40% or\n        more of its storage inactive. Therefore, aligning both the retention\n        time and the use of an appropriate table type with business and\n        recovery requirements is paramount to keeping costs under control.\n        Review High Churn tables on a consistent basis to ensure their\n        configuration is as desired.\n* **Proactively clean up unused objects:**\n  \n    + **Large tables that are never queried:** Establish a process to\n        identify, rename, and eventually drop tables that have not been\n        queried for an extended period. You can use the [ACCESS\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/access-history) account usage view to review the last time a table was selected\n        from. Snowflake’s [Cost Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) will also check weekly for unused tables on your behalf.\n    + **Short-lived permanent tables:** For staging or intermediate data\n        that is rebuilt frequently, use [TRANSIENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) or [TEMPORARY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient) tables instead of permanent tables to avoid unnecessary Time Travel\n        and Fail-safe storage fees.\n* **Perform catalog & stage management:**\n  \n+ **Data archiving:** For historical data that is rarely accessed,\n        consider moving it to cooler tiers with [storage lifecycle policies](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/storage-lifecycle-policy/storage-lifecycle-policies) or deleting it altogether.\n\n**Optimizing Managed Data Structures and Access**\n\n* You do not always need to define cluster keys for all tables (unlike\n  many other relational database management systems) if Snowflake's\n  natural data loading maintains consistent micro-partition min/max\n  values relative to your query patterns. Additionally, you can disable\n  Auto-Clustering on a table while keeping its cluster key definition\n  without incurring extra costs.\n* **Infrequently used materialized views and search optimization paths:** Materialized Views and search optimization paths can incur\n  unnecessary storage and compute costs if they are no longer actively\n  utilized. Materialized Views are most effective for stable data tables\n  with repeated complex aggregations or joins, while search optimization\n  is designed for high-speed point lookup queries. Snowflake’s [Cost Insights feature](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) can help identify instances where these objects are rarely used,\n  prompting a review to determine if their performance benefits still\n  outweigh their associated costs.\n\n#### Limit data transfer\n\nData egress, the transfer of data from one cloud provider or region to\nanother, can incur substantial costs, particularly when handling large\ndata volumes. Implementing appropriate tools and best practices is\nessential to minimize these data transfer expenses and maximize business\nvalue when data egress is necessary.\n\n**Tooling: Enable proactive cost management**\n\nLeverage Snowflake's native features to gain visibility and control over\ndata transfer costs before they become a significant expense.\n\n* **Egress Cost Optimizer (ECO):** For providers of data products on the\n  Snowflake Marketplace or private listings, enabling the [Egress Cost Optimizer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco) (ECO) at the organizational level is a critical best practice. ECO is\n  an automated feature for listings with Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment.\n  It intelligently routes data through a Snowflake-managed cache,\n  allowing you to pay a one-time egress cost for the initial data\n  transfer. After that, expanding to new regions incurs zero additional\n  egress costs for the same dataset. This is a powerful tool for scaling\n  your data sharing without compounding data transfer fees.\n* **Monitoring and alerts:** To effectively manage data transfer costs,\n  utilize Snowflake's [DATA\\_TRANSFER\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/organization-usage/data_transfer_history) telemetry view. This view provides detailed insights into data\n  movement between different regions and clouds. Establish dashboards\n  and alerts to meticulously track this usage, enabling prompt detection\n  of any unexpected cost increases.\n\n**Architectural best practices: Design for minimal data movement**\n\nMinimizing data transfer costs for your workloads heavily depends on the\narchitecture of your data pipelines and applications. Adhere to the\nfollowing best practices to achieve this:\n\n* **Unloading Data:**\n  \n    + **Compress data:** When using the [COPY INTO <location>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) command to unload data, always use a compression format (e.g., GZIP,\n        BZIP2, or Brotli). This dramatically reduces the volume of data\n        transferred and directly lowers egress costs.\n    + **Filter before unloading:** Before unloading a large dataset, use\n        SQL to filter and transform the data. Unload only the required\n        columns and rows to minimize the volume of data that must leave the\n        Snowflake environment.\n* **Data replication:** Replicating a database to a Snowflake account in\n  a different geographical region or on a different cloud provider\n  incurs data transfer fees. While useful for disaster recovery, this\n  can become expensive if not managed carefully.\n  \n    + **Targeted replication:** If a full database replica is not\n        required, use [replication groups](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-intro) to replicate only the necessary databases or schemas. This granular\n        approach ensures you only pay for the data you absolutely need to\n        move.\n    + **Consider refresh cadence:** your frequency of refresh will affect\n        the amount of data that is replicated, since it acts like a snapshot\n        rather than every incremental change. Incremental ETL practices are\n        recommended even more with data that is being replicated vs full\n        table reloads.\n* **External network access and functions:**\n  \n    + **Minimize data egress:** [External functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions) and [external network access](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/external-network-access/external-network-access-overview) ,\n        which call remote services (e.g., APIs), transfer data out of\n        Snowflake. For best practice, filter data _before_ sending it to the\n        external service. Avoid writing functions that pass an entire large\n        table as an input; instead, pass only a small, pre-filtered subset.\n    + **Co-locate services:** If possible, deploy the remote service (like\n        an AWS Lambda or Azure Function) in the same cloud and region as\n        your Snowflake account to eliminate cross-region and cross-cloud\n        egress fees.\n* **Cross-cloud auto-fulfillment:**\n  \n+ **Embrace the cache:** As a data provider, enable [Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment) for your listings. As mentioned under Tooling, this feature\n        automates the replication process and works in conjunction with the\n        Egress Cost Optimizer to ensure you pay a single, upfront cost for\n        data transfer, even as your data product expands to new regions.\n* **Cross-region/cross-cloud Iceberg storage:**\n  \n+ **Centralize your catalog:** While Snowflake supports [Iceberg tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-iceberg-storage) that are external to its managed storage, be mindful of where the\n        data resides. If your Snowflake account and your Iceberg data are in\n        different regions, querying the Iceberg table will result in egress\n        costs from your cloud provider. For a well-architected solution,\n        keep your Iceberg data and your Snowflake account in the same region\n        to avoid these egress charges.\n\n#### Workload optimization\n\nWorkload optimization focuses on identifying the efficiency of your data\nprocessing activities within Snowflake. This involves a holistic\napproach encompassing the review of query syntax, data pipelines, table\nstructures, and warehouse configurations to minimize resource\nconsumption and improve performance. By addressing inefficiencies across\nthese areas, organizations can significantly reduce costs and accelerate\ndata delivery.\n\n**Query syntax optimization**\n\nInefficient queries often lead to excessive and hidden credit\nconsumption. Organizations can identify performance bottlenecks and\nunderstand the cost impact of specific SQL patterns by using Snowflake\nfeatures and adhering to SQL code best practices. This enables\ndevelopment teams to create more efficient and cost-effective code by\nhighlighting poor performing queries. Refer to the Performance\nOptimization Pillar of the Snowflake Well-Architected Framework for\ndetails on how to do this.\n\n**Utilize query history & insights for highlevel monitoring**\n\nFor broader visibility across all workloads, the Snowsight UI and the\nACCOUNT\\_USAGE schema are indispensable.\n\n* When looking for opportunities to improve, it is best to look for\n  queries that have excessive execution time across similarly run\n  queries. The newly created [Grouped Query History](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) aggregates queries to their [parameterized query hash](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-hash) and allows users to sort based on key performance indicators like\n  total queries, total latency, bytes scanned, and drill down into the\n  query execution across time. It is recommended to start with queries\n  with outsized latency and query runs.\n* The [Query History](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) page in Snowsight provides a high-level, filterable view of past and\n  currently running queries. It allows for you to drill into the Query\n  Profile for individual query statistics and investigation, even while\n  the query is running.\n* Snowflake's [Query Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-insights) feature (both a set of account usage tables and query profile\n  attributes) are also in Snowsight and can easily surface queries that\n  would benefit from optimization, such as queries with exploding joins\n  or ineffective filtering criteria that Snowflake will surface on your\n  behalf.\n\n**Leverage the query profile for deep-dive analysis**\n\nAfter identifying problematic queries, the [Query Profile](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity) is an essential tool for understanding the execution plan of a query. It\nprovides a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of every operator involved,\nfrom data scanning to final result delivery. To gain visibility into\ninefficiencies, analysts and developers should regularly use the Query\nProfile to identify common anti-patterns like:\n\n* **Nodes with high execution time:** Pinpoint specific operations\n  (e.g., a complex join or a sort operation) that consume the majority\n  of the query's execution time.\n* **\"Exploding\" joins:** Identify Cartesian products or other\n  inefficient joins that create a much larger number of rows than\n  expected.\n* **Excessive table scanning:** In the profile, compare Partitions\n  scanned to Partitions total. A large number of scanned partitions on a\n  clustered table often indicates an opportunity to improve table\n  pruning by adding or refining cluster keys or modifying WHERE clause\n  predicates.\n* **Data spillage:** Look for operators spilling data to local or remote\n  disk. This indicates that the warehouse memory is insufficient for the\n  operation, resulting in significant performance degradation. This\n  might suggest a need to temporarily increase warehouse size for that\n  specific workload or rewrite the query to consume less memory.\n\n**Programmatically deconstruct queries for automated analysis**\n\nFor advanced use cases and automated monitoring, you can\nprogrammatically access query performance data. The [GET\\_QUERY\\_OPERATOR\\_STATS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/get_query_operator_stats) function can be used to retrieve the granular, operator-level statistics\nfor a given query ID, showing many of the steps and attributes available\nin the query profile view. This allows you to build automated checks\nthat, for instance, flag any query where a full table scan accounts for\nmore than 90% of the execution time or where data spillage exceeds a\ncertain threshold. This approach helps scale performance visibility\nbeyond manual checks.\n\n**Pipeline optimization**\n\nSnowflake pipeline optimization is about designing and managing data\ningestion and transformation processes that are efficient,\ncost-effective, scalable, and low-maintenance, while balancing business\nvalue and SLAs (service levels for freshness and responsiveness). Key\nlevers include architecture patterns (truncate & load versus incremental\nloads), use of serverless managed services (e.g., Snowpipe, Dynamic\nTables), and auditing loading practices to maximize cost and performance\nbenefits.\n\n**Batch loading**\n\nThe COPY INTO\n( [table](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table) or [location](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location) )\ncommand is a foundational and flexible method for bulk data loading from\nan external stage into a Snowflake table. Its importance lies in its\nrole as a powerful, built-in tool for migrating large volumes of\nhistorical data or loading scheduled batch files. The best practice is\nto use COPY INTO for one-time or large batch data loading jobs, which\ncan then be supplemented with more continuous ingestion methods like\nSnowpipe for incremental data. Additional information regarding COPY\nINTO and general data loading best practices can be found in our\ndocumentation [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/data-load-considerations) .\nSome additional best practices are outlined below.\n\n* **File and batch sizing:** Optimal performance is achieved with files\n  sized 100–250 MB compressed. Too few large files or too many very\n  small files reduce load parallelism and reduce efficiency.\n* **Parallelism:** Size and configure your warehouse cluster to match\n  the number and typical size of files to be loaded. (e.g., an XS\n  warehouse has eight threads; to utilize it fully, you need at least\n  eight files).\n* **File organization:** Partition files in external stages by logical\n  paths (date, region, etc.) to allow selective/cost-effective loads and\n  enable easy partition-level reloading.\n* **Pattern filtering:** Use COPY's pattern and files parameter to\n  precisely select the right files for each load, particularly to avoid\n  scanning entire stages.\n* **Resource management:** Use resource monitors and low auto-suspend\n  settings on load warehouses to minimize idle compute costs. For more\n  information here see our section on Resource Monitors.\\*\\* \\*\\*\n\n**Serverless ingestion**\n\nWhile named similarly, [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro) and [Snowpipe Streaming](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowpipe-streaming/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview) are different serverless methods to ingest data. You would utilize one\nversus the other depending on your SLA requirements for data delivery,\nand based on how data is landing for consumption.\n\n* **Snowpipe (file-based micro-batch ingestion)** : Use Snowpipe for\n  continuous ingestion of files where near real-time availability is\n  acceptable and ingestion frequency is moderate. File size guidance is\n  the same as COPY INTO (100-250MB). This leverages serverless compute\n  to avoid warehouse management overhead.\n* **Snowpipe Streaming (rowset-based, real-time ingestion)** : Use\n  Snowpipe Streaming for very low-latency (sub-five-second) ingestion,\n  high throughput, and streaming sources (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis, and\n  event hubs). You will want to ensure “exactly-once guarantees” with\n  offset tokens for idempotency. Ideally, you would batch insert as much\n  as possible to reduce API call overhead, but avoid building streaming\n  applications just to load large \"batch\" files.\n\n**Data Transformation Optimization**\n\nIn general, there are two major transformation strategies followed in\nSnowflake. One is “truncate & load,” which involves full data\nreplacement and reloading, and one is incrementally loading new data\ninto an object, possibly requiring an upsert operation. Below is some\ngeneral guidance on when to use each.\n\n* **Truncate & load:** This is utilized when full data replacement is\n  acceptable and the dataset volume/size allows for fast reloads. In\n  this case, data change patterns are such that identifying incremental\n  deltas is expensive or unreliable and downstream consumers can\n  tolerate occasional brief periods of incomplete data (during load).\n  \n+ **Best practices:** Schedule loads during off-peak or agreed “quiet”\n        windows. Consider transient or temporary tables to stage incoming\n        data, maximize parallelism during the load, and then do an atomic\n        swap/rename to minimize downtime. Ensure that you carefully manage\n        object dependencies, constraints, and statistical metadata refresh\n        after reloads to ensure proper performance once data is loaded\n* **Incremental loads:** Incremental loads are best when datasets are\n  large and a full reload is too costly, slow, or would create\n  unacceptable latency. Change-data-capture (CDC), event streaming, or\n  other means are available to reliably identify deltas (inserts,\n  updates, deletes). Additionally, in these cases, downstream consumers\n  require near-continuous data availability or very low data latency and\n  freshness.\n  \n    + **Best practices:** Design pipelines to deduplicate, merge, and\n        correctly apply CDC deltas using staging tables, Streams, and merge\n        operations. Ideally, you use Stream objects on source tables to\n        track changes efficiently if utilizing Streams or Tasks, and use\n        Tasks to automate processing. Dynamic tables are also an option;\n        please see below. Additionally, for batch files: organize files by\n        partitioned paths and use file loading patterns that enable max\n        parallelism (see COPY INTO guidance below).\n    + Test workloads on [Snowflake’s Generation 2 warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-gen2) that incorporate software improvements for data manipulation.\n\nA great example of truncate & load versus incremental can be seen in\nrefresh strategies for [Dynamic Tables (DTs)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-about) .\nThey are also a cost-effective and low-maintenance way to maintain data\npipelines. Dynamic tables provide a powerful, automated way to build\ncontinuous data transformation pipelines with SQL, eliminating the need\nfor manual task orchestration that was historically architected with\nstreams & tasks in Snowflake. [Streams & tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-pipelines-intro) still have their uses, but general guidance and ease of use see more\nSnowflake users leaning towards DTs for automated data pipelines since\nthe pipeline definitions are defined in one object or in a chain of\nobjects.\n\nThe [key concepts of dynamic tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-refresh) are defined in our documentation. However, best practices and\ndetermining when to use DTs versus other methods of pipeline tooling in\nSnowflake still warrant discussion, and are compared in Snowflake’s [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-comparison) .\n\nIn addition to Snowflake’s published [best practices](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-table-performance-guide) ,\nconsider the following\n\n* **Default to AUTO refresh** : Override only as needed for predictable\n  SLAs.\n* **Keep incremental refresh-friendly queries simple:** Avoid complex\n  nested joins, CTEs, and limit the number of outer joins per DT. The\n  introduction of complexity for incremental refresh may result in\n  longer times for execution, which in turn could force Snowflake in\n  AUTO to perform a full refresh rather than incremental.\n* **Incremental refresh is optimal** when less than 5% of the rows\n  change between refresh cycles, and source tables are well clustered by\n  relevant keys.\n* **For very complex/large transformations:** Chain multiple DTs for\n  better incrementalization, rather than building one massive DT.\n* **Monitor actual lag and refresh metrics** to adjust lag or warehouse\n  sizing as cost and response time needs evolve.\n* **Prefer a dedicated warehouse for DT refresh** during pipeline\n  development and cost analysis to isolate consumption, then consider\n  sharing for production.\n* **Use transient DTs** for high-throughput, non-critical staging steps\n  to keep storage costs down.\n* **Avoid non-deterministic functions in incremental DTs** (e.g.,\n  random, volatile UDFs, queries depending on CURRENT\\_USER).\n\nMore information on dynamic tables versus streams & tasks versus\nmaterialized views can be found in the Snowflake documentation [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-comparison) .\n\n**Table pruning optimization**\n\nTable scanning operations are one of the most resource-intensive aspects\nof query execution. Minimizing the scan of data partitions in a table\n(called partition pruning) can provide significant improvements to both\nperformance and cost for data operations in Snowflake. The account usage\nviews [TABLE\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/table_query_pruning_history) and [COLUMN\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/column_query_pruning_history) provide aggregated data on query execution, showing metrics such as\npartitions scanned and rows matched, which helps identify tables with\npoor pruning efficiency. By analyzing this data, you can determine the\nmost frequently accessed columns that are leading to a high number of\nunnecessarily scanned micro-partitions. Common ways to optimize these\naccess patterns are by using Automatic Clustering and Search\nOptimization.\n\nTo determine tables that can most benefit from re-ordering how data is\nstored, you can review Snowflake’s [best practice](https://medium.com/snowflake/supercharging-snowflake-pruning-using-new-account-usage-views-52530b24bf2e) on how to analyze the TABLE\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY and\nCOLUMN\\_QUERY\\_PRUNING\\_HISTORY account usage views. Fundamentally,\nreducing the percentage of partitions in each table pruned to the\npercentage of rows returned in a query will lead to the most optimized\ncost and performance for any given workload.\n\nA table’s Ideal pruning state is scanning the same % of rows matched as\npartitions read, minimizing unused read rows.\n\n**Warehouse optimization**\n\nWarehouse concurrency, type, and sizing can impact the execution\nperformance and cost of queries within Snowflake. Review the compute\noptimization section for more information into the tuning of the\nwarehouse and its effect on cost and performance.\n\n#### Improve continually\n\nOptimization is a continuous process that ensures all workloads not only\ndrive maximum business value but also do so in an optimal manner. By\nregularly reviewing, analyzing, and refining your Snowflake environment,\nyou can identify inefficiencies, implement improvements, and adapt your\nplatform to the ever-evolving business needs. The following set of steps\nwill help you continue to improve your environment as you grow:\n\n**Step 1: Identify & investigate workloads to improve**\n\nBegin by regularly reviewing (usually on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly\ncadence) workloads that could benefit from optimization, using\nSnowflake's [Cost Insights](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-insights) ,\ndeviations in unit economics or health metrics (from the Visibility\nprinciple), or objects hitting control limits (e.g., queries hitting\nwarehouse timeouts from the Control principle). Once identified,\ninvestigate these findings through the Cost Management UI, Cost Anomaly\ndetection, Query History, or custom dashboards with Account Usage Views\nto pinpoint the root cause. Then, using the recommendations in the\nOptimize Pillar, make improvements to the workload or object.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate & test**\n\nBefore implementing changes, estimate the potential impact on cost and\nperformance. Estimation encompasses both the expected amount of time\nrequired to make a change (for instance, consolidating warehouses will\nnecessitate more coordination effort for teams using the resource than\naltering a configuration setting) as well as the hard cost of\nimplementation. Snowflake provides helpful cost estimation functions for\nserverless features, such as [auto clustering](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_estimate_automatic_clustering_costs) and [search optimization service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_estimate_search_optimization_costs) ,\nto help make this a more data-driven process. If an estimation tool is\nnot available, making changes in a development or test environment on a\nsubset of the workload can provide an estimate and expected impact.\n\n**Step 3: Decide & implement**\n\nBased on your estimations and test results, decide whether to move\nforward with the change, ensuring the cost-benefit aligns with\nperformance or business needs. If approved, proceed to productionize the\nchange, integrating it into your live environment.\n\n**Step 4: Monitor & analyze**\n\nFinally, monitor and analyze the implemented changes to track and\nvalidate the change’s success over a period of time. This involves using\nthe same investigation methods, like utilizing the Cost Management UI\nand Account Usage Views, and comparing cost and performance metrics\nbefore and after the change to articulate the business impact. Translate\nthe technical improvements into tangible business benefits. For example,\n\"Optimizing this query reduced monthly warehouse costs by $X and\nimproved report generation time by Y minutes, allowing business users to\nmake faster decisions.\" This helps to both demonstrate the value of your\noptimization efforts to stakeholders and business value to the company.\nFinally, course-correct as needed depending on the results of the\nmonitoring\n\nThis continual improvement framework is the culmination of all subtopics\nwithin the Cost Optimization Pillar and provides a consistent way for\nyou to grow healthily on Snowflake.\n\nUpdated2025-11-24\n\nThis content is provided as is, and is not maintained on an ongoing basis.
