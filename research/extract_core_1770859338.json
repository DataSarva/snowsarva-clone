This discrepancy is caused by the methods used to determine daily credit and storage usage. To determine these values, the APPLICATION\\_DAILY\\_USAGE\\_HISTORY view uses the current session’s [TIMEZONE](../parameters.html) parameter and the Snowsight cost management tools use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To resolve any discrepancies, Snowflake recommends setting the TIMEZONE parameter to UTC.\n\n### CREDITS\\_USED\\_BREAKDOWN array [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nThe CREDITS\\_USED\\_BREAKDOWN array provides details about the services that consumed daily credits.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n[ \n  { \n    \"credits\": 0.005840921,\n    \"serviceType\": \"AUTO_CLUSTERING\" \n  } ,\n  { \n    \"credits\": 0.115940725,\n    \"serviceType\": \"SERVERLESS_TASK\" \n  } ,\n  { \n    \"credits\": 6.033448041,\n    \"serviceType\": \"SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES\" \n  } \n ]\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThe following table provides descriptions for the key-value pairs in the objects in the array.\n\n|Field |Data type |Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|`credits` |DECIMAL |Number of credits consumed by the service type specified by `serviceType` on the usage date. |\n|`serviceType` |VARCHAR |The service type, which can be one of the following values:\n\n* `AUTO_CLUSTERING` — See [Automatic Clustering](../../user-guide/tables-auto-reclustering) .\n* `DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING` — See [Introduction to data quality and data metric functions](../../user-guide/data-quality-intro) .\n* `MATERIALIZED_VIEW` — See [Working with Materialized Views](../../user-guide/views-materialized) .\n* `PIPE` — See [Snowpipe](../../user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro) .\n* `SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION` — See [Search optimization service](../../user-guide/search-optimization-service) .\n* `SERVERLESS_TASK` — See [Introduction to tasks](../../user-guide/tasks-intro) .\n* `SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES` — See [Snowpark Container Services](../../developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) .\n* `WAREHOUSE_METERING` — See [Overview of warehouses](../../user-guide/warehouses-overview) . |\n\n\nThe following are used in the determination of credit consumption:\n\n* The credits used by objects in the Snowflake Native App. For example, auto-clustering on tables in the Snowflake Native App.\n* The credits used by the warehouses owned by the Snowflake Native App.\n* The credits used by the compute pools dedicated to the Snowflake Native App.\n\n### STORAGE\\_ BYTES\\_ BREAKDOWN array [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nThe STORAGE\\_BYTES\\_BREAKDOWN array provides details about the services that consumed storage.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n[ \n  { \n    \"bytes\": 34043221,\n    \"storageType\": \"DATABASE\" \n  } ,\n  { \n    \"bytes\": 109779541,\n    \"storageType\": \"FAILSAFE\" \n  } \n ]\n```\n\nCopy\n\nThe following table provides descriptions for the key-value pairs in the objects in the array.\n\n|Field |Data type |Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|`bytes` |INTEGER |Number of storage bytes used. |\n|`storageType` |VARCHAR |The storage type, which can be one of the following values:\n\n* `DATABASE` : Database storage.\n* `FAILSAFE` : [Fail-safe storage](../../user-guide/data-failsafe) .\n* `HYBRID_TABLE` : Storage for [hybrid tables](../../user-guide/tables-hybrid) . |\n\n\nOnly data stored in the Snowflake Native App is used to determine storage byte consumption.

For additional information, see [Support for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions](limitations.html) .\n\nThis topic describes the costs associated with developing, publishing and using a\nSnowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. It contains information for both providers and consumers.\n\n## Costs to consumers [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nA Snowflake Native App may incur costs in the consumer account. The total cost of running\na Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services is determined by the following:\n\n* Costs determined by the provider\n* Infrastructure costs\n\n### Costs determined by the provider [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nA provider may monetize a Snowflake Native App using any of the [paid listing pricing models](../../collaboration/provider-becoming.html) that are available in the Snowflake Marketplace. These models include subscription based and usage based plans.\n\nThis cost to the consumer is determined by the provider. Consumers pay for provider software via the Snowflake Marketplace in addition to costs associated with running Snowflake\ninfrastructure, including warehouses and compute pools.\n\n### Infrastructure costs [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nAll infrastructure costs, including those related to compute pools, warehouse compute, storage, and\ndata transfer are the responsibility of the consumer of a Snowflake Native App.\n\nA consumer can use the IN ACCOUNT clause of the [SHOW COMPUTE POOLS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-compute-pools) command to see all compute pools in their account\nand the current state of the compute pool. Costs are not incurred when a compute pool is suspended.\n\nA Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services requires at least one compute pool and might require multiple compute pools to run as\nintended. A consumer has full control over the compute resources that the app requires, and may suspend a\ncompute pool or drop an application at any time.\n\nSeparate charges for compute pool compute related to the Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services appear on the customer billing\nstatement. A consumer can determine the compute pool billing charges for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services using the [ACCOUNT USAGE views](../snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views) provided by\nSnowpark Container Services.\n\nFor more details, such as the consumption table for compute pools, contact your account representative.\n\n## Costs to providers [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nProviders can also incur costs when developing and maintaining a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services, including the\nfollowing:\n\n* Providers incur Snowpark Container Services compute costs associated with both initial development and\n  ongoing testing and support for their Snowflake Native App. The compute cost may be controlled through\n  orchestration of compute pools during provider-side development and testing.\n* The storage of container images can incur costs when a provider creates a new version or patch of\n  a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. In this context, the Docker images that the app requires are copied into an image\n  repository that is not directly accessible or observable by the provider or the consumer.\n  \n  Services in the consumer account are created from the versioned images that are stored in this\n  repository. Providers are responsible for the storage costs for the images in this stage, which\n  appear on their Snowflake bill. These costs are aggregated with other storage costs that their account incurs.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\n[Share your feedback](/feedback)\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\n[Privacy Notice](https://www.snowflake.com/privacy-policy/) [Site Terms](https://www.snowflake.com/legal/snowflake-site-terms/) Cookies Settings © 2026 Snowflake, Inc.

There can be multiple causes that result in a query\nretry. Some of these causes are _actionable_ , that is, a user can make changes to reduce or eliminate query retries for a specific query.\nFor example, if a query is retried due to an out of memory error, modifying warehouse settings might resolve the issue.\n\nSome query retries are caused by a fault that is not actionable. That is, there is no change a user can make to prevent the\nquery retry. For example, a network outage might result in a query retry. In this case, there is no change to the query or to the\nwarehouse that executes it that can prevent the query retry.\n\nThe QUERY\\_RETRY\\_TIME, QUERY\\_RETRY\\_CAUSE, and FAULT\\_HANDLING\\_TIME columns can help you optimize queries that are retried and better\nunderstand fluctuations in query performance.\n\n### Query history for hybrid tables [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nThe following notes explain when records are logged in the QUERY\\_HISTORY view for queries against hybrid tables:\n\n* Short-running queries that operate exclusively against hybrid tables do not generate a record in this\n  view or [QUERY\\_HISTORY](../functions/query_history) (Information\n  Schema table function). To monitor such queries, use the [AGGREGATE\\_QUERY\\_HISTORY](aggregate_query_history) view.\n  This view allows you to more easily monitor high-throughput operational\n  workloads for trends and issues.\n* Short-running queries that operate exclusively against hybrid tables do not provide a query profile\n  that you can inspect in Snowsight.\n* Queries against hybrid tables do generate both a record in the QUERY\\_HISTORY view and a query profile if any of the\n  following conditions are met:\n  \n    + A query is executed against any table type other than the hybrid table type. This\n        condition ensures that there is no behavior change for any existing\n        non-Unistore workloads.\n    + A query fails with an EXECUTION\\_STATUS of `failed_with_incident` (see [QUERY\\_HISTORY](../functions/query_history) ). This\n        condition ensures that you can investigate and report the specific failed\n        query to receive assistance.\n    + A query is running longer than approximately 500 milliseconds. This\n        condition ensures that you can investigate performance issues for slow queries.\n    + Query result size is too large.\n    + A query is associated with a Snowflake transaction.\n    + A query contains a system function with side effects.\n    + A query is not one of the following statement types: SELECT, INSERT,\n        DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE.\n    + A query is executed from SnowSQL, Snowsight, or Classic Console. This\n        condition ensures that you can manually generate a full query profile to\n        investigate performance issues for any specific query even if it is not\n        categorized as long-running.\n    + Even if a query does not meet any of these criteria, queries can be\n        periodically sampled to generate a record in the QUERY\\_HISTORY view and a\n        query profile to help your investigation.\n\n### PUT and GET commands [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\n\nFor the [PUT](../sql/put) and [GET](../sql/get) commands,\nan EXECUTION\\_STATUS of `success` in the [QUERY\\_HISTORY](#) does _not_ mean that data files were successfully uploaded or downloaded.\nInstead, the status indicates that Snowflake received authorization to proceed with the file transfer.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n[Visit Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)\n\n[Join the conversation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/)\n\n[Develop with Snowflake](https://developers.snowflake.com)\n\n[Share your feedback](/feedback)\n\n[Read the latest on our blog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/)\n\n[Get your own certification](https://learn.snowflake.com)\n\n[Privacy Notice](https://www.snowflake.com/privacy-policy/) [Site Terms](https://www.snowflake.com/legal/snowflake-site-terms/) Cookies Settings © 2026 Snowflake, Inc.
