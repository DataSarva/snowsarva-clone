heading\")\nContent:\nThe ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema is available in the [organization account](../user-guide/organization-accounts) and a regular account that has the ORGADMIN role enabled. How you access the views in the schema differs depending on which type of account you are using. For details about accessing views, see the following:\n[Access schema in the organization account]()\n[Access schema in an ORGADMIN-enabled account]()\nNote\nThe views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema are currently not available in [US SnowGov Regions](../user-guide/intro-regions.html) on AWS GovCloud and Microsoft Azure Government.\nSection Title: ... > Access schema in the organization account [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nBy default, only users granted the GLOBALORGADMIN role can access ORGANIZATION_USAGE views in the [organization account](../user-guide/organization-accounts) .\nTo grant access to other users, the organization administrator can grant the appropriate *application role* to an account role or user.\nUsers who have been granted the SNOWFLAKE.ORG_USAGE_ADMIN application role can access all views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema of the\norganization account. The following example lets user `joe` access all views in the schema:\n```\nUSE ROLE GLOBALORGADMIN ; \n\n GRANT APPLICATION ROLE SNOWFLAKE . ORG_USAGE_ADMIN TO ROLE custom_role ; \n\n GRANT ROLE custom_role TO USER joe ;\n```\nCopy\nThe organization administrator can also grant access on a more granular level. For example, the ORGANIZATION_OBJECT_VIEWER application role\ngrants access to the DATABASES view but does not grant access to the TASK_HISTORY view.\nSection Title: ... > Access schema in the organization account [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nUse the following list to determine which application role grants access to a specific view. These application roles are in the SNOWFLAKE\napplication. Use the fully qualified name of the application role when granting it to another role (for example,\nSNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE_VIEWER).\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Access schema in the organization account [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nview](organization-usage/storage_lifecycle_policy_history) |ORGANIZATION_GOVERNANCE_VIEWER |\n|[STORAGE_DAILY_HISTORY view](organization-usage/storage_daily_history) |ORGANIZATION_USAGE_VIEWER |\n|[TABLE_CONSTRAINTS view](organization-usage/table_constraints) |ORGANIZATION_OBJECT_VIEWER |\n|[TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS view](organization-usage/table_storage_metrics) |ORGANIZATION_USAGE_VIEWER |\n|[TABLES view](organization-usage/tables) |ORGANIZATION_OBJECT_VIEWER |\n|[TAG_REFERENCES view](organization-usage/tag_references) |ORGANIZATION_GOVERNANCE_VIEWER |\n|[TAGS view](organization-usage/tags) |ORGANIZATION_OBJECT_VIEWER |\n|[TASK_HISTORY view](organization-usage/task_history) |ORGANIZATION_USAGE_VIEWER |\n|[TASK_VERSIONS view](organization-usage/task_versions) |ORGANIZATION_OBJECT_VIEWER |\n|[TRUST_CENTER_FINDINGS view](organization-usage/trust_center_findings) |ORGANIZATION_SECURITY_VIEWER |\n|[USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY\n ... \nSection Title: Organization Usage [¶]( \"Link to this heading\") > ... > Your Privacy > Performance Cookies\nContent:\nPerformance Cookies\nThese cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.

When the spending limit is projected to be exceeded, a notification is\nsent. You can configure the budget to send this notification to a list of email addresses, a queue provided by a cloud service\n(Amazon SNS, Azure Event Grid, or Google Cloud PubSub), or a webhook for a third-party system (for example, Slack, Microsoft\nTeams, or PagerDuty).\nSection Title: ... > Account budget and custom budgets [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nThe *account budget* monitors spending for all credit usage in the account.\nYou can also create a *custom budget* to monitor the spending limits for a specific group of [supported objects](budgets/custom-budget.html) .\nFor both types of budgets, you must set up the spending limit and specify how you want to receive notifications.\nTo start using budgets in Snowflake, [activate the account budget](budgets/account-budget.html) .\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Spending limit and time interval [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nIf you create a *custom budget* after the first day of the month, historical data for the month is only backfilled for resources that were\nadded to the budget using a tag. Data from resources added individually are not backfilled.\nNote\nIf you create a custom budget and individually add resources to the budget instead of using a tag, consider the following:\nForecasting for future spend by those resources is based on the credit usage only for the days after the budget is enabled.\nYou might exceed your budget for the first month. Because the data for the resources is not backfilled, the forecasting might be\nincorrect. Subsequent months will correctly forecast credit usage based on spending history.\nSection Title: ... > Adjusting the budget refresh interval [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nA budget cannot calculate whether consumption has reached a spending limit until the budget is refreshed with the most current consumption\ndata. The time period between consumption and the budget’s receipt of information about that consumption is called the\nbudget refresh interval.\nBy default, the budget refresh interval is up to 6.5 hours. You can reduce the budget refresh interval to one hour, which can be helpful\nwhen you need to watch spending more carefully. A budget with a one-hour refresh interval is known as a *low latency budget* . You can\ntemporarily reduce the budget refresh interval to closely monitor consumption, and then set it back to the default to save on costs.\nSection Title: ... > Adjusting the budget refresh interval [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nSetting the refresh interval to one hour increases the compute cost of the budget by a factor of 12. For example, if a budget consumes one\ncredit per month when the refresh interval is 6.5 hours, then the budget consumes 12 credits per month when the refresh period is one hour.\nTo determine the current compute cost of your budgets, see [Exploring compute costs](budgets/cost.html) .\nTo adjust the budget refresh interval, call the [SET_REFRESH_TIER](../sql-reference/classes/budget/methods/set_refresh_tier) method.\nYou can also use Snowsight to adjust the interval for a custom budget by selecting or deselecting the Enable low latency budget field.\nTo retrieve the current refresh interval, call the [GET_REFRESH_TIER](../sql-reference/classes/budget/methods/get_refresh_tier) method.\nSection Title: ... > Supported services [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nBudgets monitor credit usage for the following services. Use the table to determine whether custom budgets support the service and which\nobject is associated with the service.\nNote\nAccount budget support for serverless features depends on the availability of\nservice types in the Account Usage [METERING_HISTORY view](../sql-reference/account-usage/metering_history) view.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > Budgets roles and privileges [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nTo enable a custom role in your account to work with budgets, you can grant the following roles and privileges.\nNote\nSnowflake provides application roles and database roles that control access to all cost-related features, including budgets. For\ninformation about granting these roles to a custom role rather than working with budget-specific roles and privileges, see [Access control for cost management](cost-access-control) .\nSection Title: ... > Application roles to manage the account budget [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nYou can grant the following application roles to a custom role in your account to monitor or manage the account budget:\nSection Title: ... > Application roles to manage the account budget [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\n| Application Role | Description |\n| BUDGET_VIEWER | Enables a role to view budget usage data and list the resources in the budget. |\n| BUDGET_ADMIN | Enables a role to activate or deactivate the account budget and modify the properties of a budget including spending limit, |\n| the notification integrations to use, the list of email addresses to receive notifications, and the mute notifications |  |\n| setting. |  |\nSection Title: ... > Application roles to manage the account budget [¶]( \"Link to this heading\")\nContent:\nIn addition to the application role, there are other required privileges that must be granted to enable a custom role to monitor or manage\nthe account budget.

Refer to the [Query History Page](../user-guide/ui-snowsight-activity.html) .\n\nReview the refresh frequency interval that you set for the listing.
