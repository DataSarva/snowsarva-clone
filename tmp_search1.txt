Snowflake charges a monthly fee based on the average amount of storage used over the month. The data is stored in compressed format. Depending on what kind of data you’re working with, like if you’re pulling in a bunch of raw CSVs versus more compact file types, the compression can significantly lower Snowflake storage costs.\nSection Title: Snowflake cost optimization: 8 proven strategies for reducing costs > ... > Compute layer\nContent:\nVirtual warehouses are basically compute clusters that run your queries and handle your data loads. They scale independently, and you can have more than one running at a time. The key thing to know here: compute is paid using Snowflake credits. You spin up a warehouse, and you start spending credits. You pause it, it stops costing you.

Snowflake\nstrongly recommends tags for warehouses, databases, tables, and users\nto enable granular cost breakdowns. You can use the [TAG_REFERENCES view](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/account-usage/tag_references) in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to combine with common usage views like\nWAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY and TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS to allocate usage\nto relevant business groups. Object Tags are best utilized when\nSnowflake objects are not shared across cost owners.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Query tags for granular workload attribution:** [Query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) can be set via session parameters (e.g., ALTER SESSION SET QUERY_TAG =\n'your_tag';) or directly within SQL clients or ETL tools. This\nassociates individual queries with specific departments, projects, or\napplications, even when using shared warehouses. This is extremely\nvaluable for shared warehouses where multiple teams or applications\nuse the same compute resource, allowing for granular showback. It is\nalso easy to programmatically make changes to query tags within\nscripts or processes to allocate costs appropriately. Query tags can\nbe found in the QUERY_HISTORY view of the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE\nschema.\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Tagging models**\nIn the initial setup of a business unit or use case, it is important to\nconsider the [model for tagging](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing) costs within the platform via shared or dedicated resources. These fall\ninto three large buckets:\nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\n**Resources used exclusively by a single cost center or department:** An example of this is using object tags to associate warehouses with a\ndepartment. You can use object tags to attribute the costs incurred by\nthose warehouses to that department entirely. **Resources shared by users from multiple departments:** An example of\nthis is a warehouse shared by users from different departments. In\nthis case, you use object tags to associate each user with a\ndepartment. The costs of queries are attributed to the users. Using\nthe object tags assigned to users, you can break down the costs by\ndepartment. **Applications or workflows shared by users from different departments:** An example of this is an application that issues\nqueries on behalf of its users.\n ... \nSection Title: Cost Optimization > ... > Overview > Establish a consistent and granular cost attribution strategy\nContent:\nEach model has its pros and cons, including how to handle concepts such\nas idle time or whether to show/charge back attributed or billed\ncredits.

While Snowflake’s per-second billing offers flexibility, it also means a single efficient query can eat through hundreds of dollars – which is why manual warehouse management can’t keep pace with enterprise-sized workloads.\nThe bright side: modern Snowflake FinOps fixes this with automated systems that allow you to optimize spend and performance in real time.\nHow do you get to that point? Read on. We’ll share all of our FinOps best practices,e automation strategies, and real-world tactics that have helped enterprises cut monthly Snowflake costs by 30% or more.\n ... \nSection Title: Snowflake FinOps: Complete Guide to Automated Cost Optimization > ... > The Compliance Complexity\nContent:\nEnterprise FinOps needs control, not just cost reduction. You’ll find manual approaches falling short of this:\n**Granular spend attribution** across cost centers and teams\n**Real-time budget enforcement** to prevent runaway costs\n**Audit trails** for compliance and chargeback scenarios\n**Role-based access** maintaining security while enabling autonomy\nThese challenges only continue to compound as you scale, making manual management not just expensive, but impossible to maintain.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > : Implement Granular Cost Attribution\nContent:\n**The problem:** Snowflake’s native cost reporting only shows warehouse-level spending. You need query- and team-level attribution for effective chargeback.\n**The solution:** Build automated tagging and attribution using Snowflake’s metadata like this:\n```\n-- Set up cost attribution table\nCREATE TABLE cost_attribution AS\nSELECT\n  qh.query_id,\n  qh.user_name,\n  qh.warehouse_name,\n  qh.database_name,\n  qh.schema_name,\n  qh.credits_used_cloud_services,\n  -- Extract team from username pattern or use session context\n  CASE\n    WHEN qh.user_name ILIKE '%analytics%' THEN 'Analytics Team'\n    WHEN qh.user_name ILIKE '%eng%' THEN 'Engineering Team'\n    ELSE 'General'\n  END as team_attribution,\n  qh.start_time\nFROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history qh\nWHERE qh.start_time >= dateadd(day, -30, current_timestamp());\n```\nYou can use this to pull key metrics like:\nSection Title: ... > : Implement Granular Cost Attribution\nContent:\nCost per team per month: SUM(credits_used * $3) GROUP BY team_attribution\nMost expensive users: SUM(credits_used) GROUP BY user_name\nWarehouse efficiency: credits_used / execution_time ratio\nSection Title: ... > : Automated Chargeback and Showback Models\nContent:\n**The problem:** No clear cost attribution means that teams often treat Snowflake as if it were “free,” leading to wasteful usage and budget overruns.\n**The solution:** Automated cost attribution that gets you accountability without expensive administration overhead:\n**Tag-based attribution** that automatically assigns costs to projects and business units\n**Usage-based chargeback** for shared warehouses using per-query\n**Predictive showback** forecasting team spend based on current trends\n**ROI tracking** connecting data platform costs to business outcomes\nManual tagging doesn’t scale.
